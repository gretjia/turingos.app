//! TRACE_MATRIX FC1a-judge_pi: TDMA-Bounded JudgeAI predicate module.
//!
//! Constitution explicitly permits JudgeAI as a verdict authority for FC1
//! predicates. This module holds the math-step judge used in the Atom 7.5
//! real-evidence run on the user-supplied problem
//! "证明所有自然数之和 = -1/12 via m·exp(-m/N)·cos(m/N)".
