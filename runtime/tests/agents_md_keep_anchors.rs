//! Phase 4 (harness platform-agnostic unification, 2026-05-29) — KEEP-anchor
//! survival gate for the slimmed `AGENTS.md`.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` is read by every platform every session, so Phase 4 slimmed it
//! by the irreducibility rule: remove a line only if removing it loses no
//! governance. The danger of that operation is *silent* governance loss — a
//! dedup or deletion that also drops a load-bearing rule. (Phase 2 already did
//! this once: deleting the `turingos_dev` §10 silently removed the only
//! `fail-closed` mention; this gate exists partly so that never recurs unseen.)
//!
//! This test makes "zero loss of load-bearing governance" FALSIFIABLE: it
//! asserts each KEEP-list anchor is still literally present in `AGENTS.md`. If
//! a future edit removes or renames any anchor, this test goes RED — exactly
//! the §7 "gate tests must be able to fail" property. `keep_anchor_checker_can_fail`
//! proves the matcher is not vacuously green.
//!
//! These are CONTENT anchors (does the contract still say the rule), distinct
//! from `cli_entry_files_redirect_to_agents.rs`, which checks the thin CLI
//! files point here without narrowing. Anchors are matched as substrings, not
//! exact lines, so benign rewording is allowed; deletion is not.
