//! K-3.1' CI redundancy mirror of `rules/active/R-*.yaml` (subset).
//!
//! ## Why "mirror" not "replacement"
//!
//! Adversarial review (A1) found that `rules/engine.py` is invoked
//! synchronously by `.claude/hooks/judge.sh` as a **PreToolUse** hook.
//! `judge.sh` exits 2 to block writes BEFORE they touch disk. `cargo test`
//! is post-write (after file is on disk) and takes 5-30s, so it cannot
//! replace `engine.py`'s sub-second pre-edit blocking.
//!
//! K-3.1' (this file) adds a **CI redundancy mirror**: for the subset of
//! YAML rules whose check is pure-grep on file content, we add a Rust
//! test that re-runs the grep at CI time. This is defense-in-depth:
//!
//! - `rules/engine.py` blocks edits at write-time (primary enforcement)
//! - `tests/constitution_rules_ci_mirror.rs` (this file) catches violations
//!   at CI time if engine.py was bypassed (e.g., direct git commit, hook
//!   disabled, etc.)
//!
//! Both layers must stay in sync. If a YAML rule changes, this file's
//! corresponding test must be updated. See `rules/active/R-*.yaml` for
//! the source-of-truth patterns.
//!
//! ## Non-mirrored rules (need engine state or non-content checks)
//!
//! The following YAML rules are NOT mirrored here because their check
//! requires runtime state beyond file content grep:
//!
//! - R-003 wal deletion (matches `rm` commands, not file content)
//! - R-006 kernel modification (matches any edit, needs change-event context)
//! - R-007 bus lifecycle (lifecycle-aware)
//! - R-009 payload limits (numeric config, needs parse)
//! - R-013 format contract (needs schema validation)
//! - R-014 trust root manifest drift (needs hash recomputation)
//! - R-018 constitution amendment sudo (needs sudo flag check)
//! - R-022 trace matrix pub symbol block (state-aware)
//!
//! For these, `rules/engine.py` remains the only enforcement layer.
