TuringOS v4 is a tape-first constitutional operating substrate for LLM/AGI
agents. The authoritative state of a run is ChainTape plus CAS evidence; reports,
dashboards, and handover notes are materialized views.

## Handover State

Active: `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` (2026-05-29 post-merge
reconciliation after PR #212 and PR #214). This file is a derived view; if it
conflicts with ChainTape/CAS, executable gates, or merged PR receipts, trust the
authoritative evidence.

Current orientation package:

- `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` — current merged baseline and open caveats.
- `handover/reports/TURINGOS_REAL_ROADMAP_STATUS_2026-05-29.md` — correction
  of the stale "真实落地路线图" article against current main.
- `OBLIGATIONS.md` — OBL-001 through OBL-009 are currently `satisfied`.

Sessions #1-#54 are archived at:
`handover/ai-direct/LATEST_ARCHIVE_PRE_2026-05-20_sessions_1_to_54.md`.

## Current Main Status

As of `origin/main@7298b927` (Merge #340, 2026-06-09), `main` includes the Phase E
libgit2 cutover, flowchart closure, no-zombie/liveness gates, the platform-agnostic
audit doctrine, the **agentic-OS roadmap S1–S6** (#315–#324), the **`turingos`
product CLI** (`init` → `spec` → `generate` → `observe`), the **1.0 product-flow
hardening + non-fatal functional gate** (#338), an **operator VPPUT in
`tdma run`** (#339), and the **Class-4 agent-signature ingress fail-closure**
(#340, all 12 agent economic tx variants verified at ingress + replay — closing
OBS_AGENT_SIG_REPLAY_GAP for untrusted external agents). Current constitution gate
result from a clean `origin/main` worktree:

```text
bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh
# [k-1-5] total=194 failed=0
```

(`cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`: 479 test binaries, 0 failed.)

Current high-signal facts:

- **Git / tape substrate**: TDMA paths use `GitTapeLedger` via `git2`; runtime
  truth is ChainTape + CAS + replay, not dashboards or README text.
- **Obligation ledger**: `OBLIGATIONS.md` marks OBL-001 through OBL-009
  `satisfied`.
- **Audit doctrine**: one platform-agnostic clean-context audit by any capable
  fresh agent; the old vendor-specific single/dual-audit language is retired.
- **`turingos_dev`**: retired in PR #213; gate count dropped from 165 to 164
  because `constitution_dev_harness` was removed.
- **Internal market substrate**: CompleteSet, CPMM, atomic router, YES/NO
  positions, and replayed market actions are active typed-transaction surfaces.
  The generated market path now requires `MarketSeed -> CpmmPool ->
  BuyWithCoinRouter(YES) -> BuyWithCoinRouter(NO) -> Verify -> FinalizeReward
  -> EventResolve`. Price remains a signal, never predicate truth.
- **SWE-bench judge**: PR #212 wires `turingos tdma run --judge swebench` to a
  real SWE-bench hidden-test verifier path. Current honest result is loop 0/3,
  bare 0/3; the verifier/runtime path exists, but no loop advantage is claimed.
- **Product CLI + delivery contract (2026-06-09, #338)**: `turingos generate`
  delivers structurally-valid code with an HONEST exit code (a printed delivery
  is never retracted by a downstream economic break; a genuine pre-delivery /
  structural failure exits 2). The spec-derived functional check is **non-fatal**
  (best-effort needle from fuzzy LLM prose → deliver + on-tape advisory + warn,
  never a hard reject); structural gates (entrypoint exists/parses) still
  hard-block. `turingos observe` gives a read-only FC1/FC2/FC3 liveness +
  no-zombie + integer-VPPUT rollup over a workspace tape.
- **Untrusted-agent ingress security (2026-06-09, #340, Class-4 §8)**: all 12
  agent economic typed-tx variants are signature-verified FAIL-CLOSED at
  `submit_agent_tx` ingress (`SubmitError::AgentManifestRequired` when no manifest
  is configured) AND at replay Gate 4. Demonstrated at 100-agent Byzantine scale
  (`tests/adversarial_100_agent_scale.rs`).
- **Note**: the earlier `13f2760f`-era web-feature smoke blocker
  (`generate_emits_work_tx_smoke` private-`TaskId` import) predates this snapshot;
  re-verify against current `main` before relying on it either way.

### Recent Milestones

- **PR #340** (2026-06-09, Class-4 §8 `APPROVE-AGENT-SIG-INGRESS-FAILCLOSED-ALL-12`):
  close OBS_AGENT_SIG_REPLAY_GAP — all 12 agent economic tx variants fail-closed

  increment; explicit non-claim of OS-level hermetic/no-network sandboxing.

### V4 Product-CAK Hardening (P7.z) — 2026-05-20/21

`main` now contains the full Product-CAK evidence chain from spec interview
through artifact generation, preview, test run, and rejection — every step
anchored as a `ObjectType::EvidenceCapsule` in CAS with a deterministic
`schema_id` tag. The chain shape:

```
SpecCapsule
  └─ GenerationAttemptCapsule (C2)
        └─ ArtifactBundleManifest (C3) — typed `role` enum, path-traversal
              regex, cross-field invariants, immutability rule (every regen
              = new CID)
              ├─ PreviewRunCapsule (C6) — read-only observation; world head
              │                            unchanged
              ├─ TestRunCapsule (C11) — spec-derived TestScenarioSet,
              │                          hidden-oracle shielded,
              │                          accepted_delivery gate
              └─ GenerateRejectionCapsule (C8, L4.E) — v5-derived 4-tuple +
                    world_head_unchanged invariant; private_diagnostic_cid
                    shielded from HTTP body and BuildSessionView
                    └─ BuildSessionView (C7, derived projection, not
                          capsule) — rebuilds session from CAS without UI
                          session cache
                          └─ Offline replay + spec audit (C9) — CAS-only
                                `turingos replay --offline` with cross-CID
                                reference verification
```

Plus production-admission **C10**: `PromptPromotionReceipt` runtime guard
wired into 3 LLM startup sites in `cmd_generate.rs` and `cmd_llm.rs`;
refuses to start LLM unless a CAS-anchored promotion receipt with matching
prompt CID exists. Env-var bypass forbidden (`TURINGOS_BYPASS_PROMOTION_GUARD`
ignored).

**Cz Class 4** atom aligned `genesis_payload.toml`'s `trust_root` section
with post-merge content: rehashed `src/runtime/mod.rs`, `Cargo.toml`,
`src/bottom_white/cas/store.rs`, `tests/tb_7_legacy_append_regression.rs`;
removed 14 deleted `experiments/minif2f_v4/*` pins (user-authorized minif2f
deletion was part of C3); added 6 missing `pub mod` declarations
(`preview_run`, `build_session_view`, `replay`, `prompt_promotion`,
`test_scenario`, `test_run`). User §8 + Codex independent witness PROCEED.

Verification: `cargo test --lib boot::tests::` 8/8 PASS, including
`verify_trust_root_passes_on_intact_repo` (was failing on main pre-Cz with
`Tampered { expected: "05bf7151...", actual: "a3a09109..." }`).

7 new schema-ids in CAS, all `ObjectType::EvidenceCapsule`-tagged:
`turingos-generation-attempt-v1`, `turingos-artifact-bundle-v1`,
`turingos-preview-run-v1`, `turingos-generate-rejection-v1`,
`turingos-prompt-promotion-v1`, `turingos-test-scenario-set-v1`,
`turingos-test-run-v1`.

### Pre-P7.z baseline (preserved through session #56)

- `main` includes the audited **TISR Phase 6.3.y grill-driven Generative UI
  ship unit** merged by PR #11 as merge commit
  `300fb563ae57d971610b923d83fc55ab083ae245`. This preserves the six
  ship-unit commits for auditability:
  - A6 + A8b: move `spec_capsule` into `src/runtime/` and load synthesis
    prompts from assets instead of inline literals.
  - F2 + A2: strip `<think>` blocks in strict JSON completion paths and add
    `turingos llm prompt-eval` for future prompt regression gates.
  - F11: make `cmd_generate` quality predicates domain-agnostic via
    `VerifyMode::MinimumBar`.
  - F1/F3/F4/F5/F6/F9/F10: harden the web spec turn loop, meta-prompt wiring,
    error handling, transcript rollback, and slot-keyed spec synthesis.
  - Archive v2/v3 sibling prompts as candidates, not active production
    prompts.
  - Add the ultraplan evidence and clean-context audit/disposition trail.
- Phase 6.3.y demonstrated the Step 0 -> Step 3 Generative UI path
  (spec interview -> CAS-anchored spec capsule -> code generation -> browser
  preview) on the P7 Traditional Chinese persona. The shipped binary remains
  on canonical v1 prompts; v2/v3 prompt evidence is archived and conditional,
  pending a future A11 promotion via the A2 prompt-eval gate.
- `main` includes the audited **TISR Phase 7 Web MVP** merged by PR #6
  as squash commit
  `eab583fd30f278db26ef2ab98c39eaf010333a22`. Phase 7 wraps the Phase 6.3
  `spec → generate → play` CLI flow in an HTTP + WebSocket server
  (`src/web/**` + `src/bin/turingos_web.rs`) plus a vanilla-TS +
  Web Components frontend (`frontend/**`). Run
  `cargo build --features web --bin turingos_web` (after `cd frontend &&
  npm run build`), then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/welcome` for the
  onboarding wizard.
- Phase 7 highlights:
  - 14 axum routes (4 HTML + 3 JSON IR + 1 WS + spec/generate/artifact
    + task-open + static), all bound to `127.0.0.1:8080` (no flag /
    no env override).
  - Auto-retry on heuristic-fail (W8 → W8.1 → W8.2): server-side
    post-generate heuristic verifier with WS progress events. Closed
    via a 4-round real-LLM E2E with 3-role cross-validation
    (user-simulator + backend-observer + Test Director).
  - API key stays in-memory only
    (`AppState.api_key: Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>>`); never
    `localStorage`, never logged, never persisted.
  - Artifact viewer uses `iframe sandbox="allow-scripts"`-only with
    a `SANDBOX_ALLOWED_TOKENS` guard against any `allow-same-origin`
    combo. Path-traversal triple-defended in
    `src/web/artifact.rs` (whitelist regex + `canonicalize()` +
    prefix-check).
- `main` includes the audited **TISR Phase 6.0–6.3 alpha CLI stack**
  merged by PR #4 as squash commit
  `ff866c53fa2622b2a4d3a944df8cee70874e2834`.
- `turingos` CLI is the primary user entry point. The stack registers
  ~25 subcommands across families `init` / `report` / `verify` / `audit` /
  `preflight` / `replay` / `task` / `config` / `agent` / `batch` /
  `export` / `render` / `welcome` / `llm` / `spec` / `generate`. Run
  `turingos --help` for the full surface.
- Phase 6.3 adds a real SiliconFlow-backed two-LLM wire:
  Meta (reasoning) defaults to `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2`; Blackbox
  (codegen) defaults to `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct`. The API key
  is never persisted to disk — only the env-var NAME is stored in
  `<workspace>/turingos.toml`.
- `turingos spec` runs an 8-question non-developer customer-development
  grill (Chinese-first), emits `spec.md`, and anchors the bytes in CAS as
  an `EvidenceCapsule` (`schema_id = turingos-spec-capsule-v1`). The spec
  capsule logic now lives in `src/runtime/spec_capsule.rs` so both CLI and web
  paths can synthesize and verify capsules through the same library surface.
  The CID is printed to stdout and is read back by `turingos welcome` to flip
  the "spec done" status. `turingos generate` then drives codegen against the
  Blackbox model.
- `main` also includes the audited CAS Git constitutional repair merged by
  PR #3 at commit `802b18053d063bd5503a6b0eb2e7b1f46ceda93b`. CAS now has
  a Git commit-chain layer while preserving `Cid = sha256(content)`;
  `refs/chaintape/cas` advances as a CAS commit head for new writes, and
  `CasStore::open()` / reload paths take the same chain lock used by
  `put()`.
- **MiniF2F deletion** (2026-05-19/20, user-authorized cleanup): the
  `experiments/minif2f_v4/` subproject was removed from main as part of PR
  #46 (Atom C3). It is no longer a development benchmark package in this
  repository. The trust_root section in `genesis_payload.toml` was updated
  by Cz to drop the 14 minif2f file pins. Use `~/projects/turingosv3` or
  the prior session archives for any historical minif2f research; the
  current main is minif2f-free.

## Phase 6.3.y / 7 follow-ups

1. **Prompt promotion**: v2/v3 grill prompts are archived in `assets/prompts/`
   but are not active. Promote them only through the A11 atom using
   `turingos llm prompt-eval` on a richer eval fixture.
2. **Multi-slot slot ledger**: Mrs Chen-style answers can cover multiple
   canonical slots in one turn. F10's shipped slot-keyed mapping is improved,
   but the full fix is deferred to F12 multi-slot per-turn ledger.
3. **Provider flake hardening**: SiliconFlow transient empty `ok=false`
   responses remain a quality issue; A13 should add in-handler retry/backoff.
4. **Frontend bundle size drift**: `frontend/dist/main.js` is ~84 kB after
   PR #11. The Phase 7 ship report claimed a lower cap, and no automated CI
   assertion currently catches future drift. Either bump the documented cap
   or add a bundle-size assertion to the web route tests.
5. ~~**Frontend-build dependency**: `src/web/router.rs` uses
   `include_bytes!("../../frontend/dist/main.js")`, but `frontend/dist/`
   is gitignored. Fresh-clone `cargo build --features web` fails until
   `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`. Recommended: a `build.rs` that
   fails with a clear `npm run build` hint, or commit the dist artefact.~~
   **RESOLVED by Atom C0 (PR #43, 2026-05-20)**: `build.rs` now emits an
   actionable error message instructing the contributor to run
   `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build` when `frontend/dist/main.js`
   is missing.

## Authoritative Orientation

Read these first for a cold start:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CLAUDE.md`
3. `HARNESS_PLAYBOOK.md`
4. `constitution.md`
5. `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md`
6. `handover/alignment/CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md`
7. `handover/alignment/TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md`

Truth order is defined in `AGENTS.md`: constitution and flowchart contracts
outrank ChainTape/CAS, gates, handover, dashboards, and README text.

## Build

To build the project with the web-enabled features, you must build the frontend first. The canonical build sequence is:

1. Build the frontend assets:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```
2. Build the Rust binary:
   ```bash
   cargo build --features web --bin turingos_web
   ```

If you attempt to run `cargo build --features web` without building the frontend first, the build will fail with an error message instructing you to build the frontend.

## Core Checks

Preferred ship-level checks:

```bash
git diff --check
bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=1
```

MiniF2F is no longer part of this repository's root workspace or core
constitution gate. Use the historical v3 repository or archived evidence for
old MiniF2F research.
