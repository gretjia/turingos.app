# M07 PENDING kill-condition runner — post-§8 residual set (G3/G4/G5).
#
# UPDATE 2026-06-07 (§8 token APPROVE-M07-A4-SINGLE-ADMISSION-PREDICATE-GATE):
# G1 (pending_m07_kernel_predicate_gate) has been PROMOTED to a live constitution
# gate (tests/constitution_kernel_predicate_gate.rs, registered in
# scripts/constitution_gates.manifest.toml + the execution matrix) and is removed
# from this pending set.
#
# UPDATE 2026-06-07 (§8 packet M07_G2_G3_GATE_REDESIGN_DECISION_2026-06-07.md §5):
# G2 (pending_m07_single_admission) has been RETIRED. The as-written pending G2
# was logically self-contradictory — it asserted kernel_admitted==true AND
# seq_admitted==false AND kernel_admitted==seq_admitted (true==false), so it was
# a broken test, not a falsifiable kill-condition (AGENTS.md §7). It is replaced
# by a CORRECT live behavioral gate
# tests/constitution_single_admission_behavioral.rs (both authorities fed the
# SAME claim must reach the SAME verdict), triple-coupled into the manifest +
# matrix. The structural anti-duplication invariant is additionally enforced live
# by tests/constitution_single_admission_contract.rs. G2 is therefore removed
# from this pending set.
#
# UPDATE 2026-06-07 (§8 token APPROVE-M07-G3-OS-QUALIFIED-RUN-FIELD, Class-4):
# G3 (pending_m07_zero_root_is_not_oracle) has been PROMOTED to a live
# constitution gate (tests/constitution_predicate_zero_root_is_not_oracle.rs,
# registered in scripts/constitution_gates.manifest.toml + the execution matrix).
# The architect ruling on the os_qualified source landed as the run-level
# QState::os_qualified_t field (independent of predicate_registry_root_t, folded
# into state_root_t, flipped true by the system-only PredicateBindingActivate
# accept), which makes the zero-root refuse-path live. G3 is removed from this
# pending set. G4/G5 remain STANDING pending a separate §8.
#
# PROMOTED OUT 2026-06-07 (constitution conformance sweep, finding #3
# boot-trust-root, Class-4): the §8 token
# APPROVE-ALL-CANONICAL-WRITERS-VERIFY-TRUST-ROOT was granted and the fix landed.
#   pending_conformance_all_canonical_writers_verify_trust_root  -> PROMOTED
#   tests/pending/constitution_all_canonical_writers_verify_trust_root.rs was
#   moved (git mv) to the top-level live gate
#   tests/constitution_all_canonical_writers_verify_trust_root.rs and flipped
#   GREEN: every canonical-write binary entry (CAS put_json / GitTapeLedger /
#   live Sequencer / SystemEmitCommand) now calls
#   turingosv4::boot::verify_trust_root before work. It is triple-coupled
#   (scripts/constitution_gates.manifest.toml + CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md
#   row + the tests/constitution_*.rs glob) and runs under
#   scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh. No longer a pending gate — removed from
#   PENDING_GATES below.
#   Source: handover/audits/CONSTITUTION_CONFORMANCE_SWEEP_2026-06-07.md §2 #3;

#
# Runs the pending agentic-OS kill-condition gate set that is DELIBERATELY
# EXCLUDED from default CI. The exclusion mechanism is ZERO-CARGO.TOML:
#
#   * the gate files live under tests/pending/ — cargo does NOT auto-discover
#     .rs files in tests/ SUBDIRECTORIES (only flat tests/*.rs are integration
#     targets), so they are invisible to `cargo test` / `cargo test --workspace`
#     with NO Cargo.toml change at all. (Proven by the long-standing
#     tests/pending_probe/ invalid-Rust file that never breaks CI.)
#   * we do NOT add a [[test]] target to Cargo.toml: on this worktree Cargo.toml
#     is pinned in the Trust Root (genesis_payload.toml), so ANY edit to it
#     trips src/boot.rs::verify_trust_root (Class-4 TRUST_ROOT_TAMPERED) — which
#     is forbidden PRE-§8. We therefore compile each pending gate as a STANDALONE
#     test binary via `rustc --test`, linking the cargo-built `turingosv4` rlib.
#   * they are NOT in scripts/constitution_gates.manifest.toml, so neither
#     scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh (flat `ls tests/constitution_*.rs` glob)
#     nor tests/constitution_matrix_drift.rs (manifest-driven) sees them.
#
# These gates are EXPECTED TO FAIL (red) until the Class-4 src/ admission change
# lands under the user's §8 token. This script:
#   - builds the turingosv4 test deps once (so the rlib + dep rlibs exist),
#   - compiles each pending gate standalone via rustc --test,
#   - runs it, treats FAIL (non-zero) as the EXPECTED outcome and prints the
#     gate's standing token,
#   - errors LOUDLY if a pending gate unexpectedly PASSES (premature wire-up or
#     a vacuous assertion that must be fixed before §8) or fails to COMPILE
#     (a compile break is a real defect, not the intended assertion-red), and
#   - exits 0 iff every pending gate is in its expected (compiles + asserts-red)
#     state.
#
# Explicitly NOT a constitution gate. Does NOT run inside
# scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh and does NOT block default CI. Mirrors the
# report-not-enforce house style of scripts/audit_legacy_bypass.sh.
#
# Scope: the M07 residual pending kill-condition set (1 gate; G1 + G3 promoted
# out, G2 retired + replaced by a live behavioral gate; the 2026-06-07
# conformance-sweep boot-trust-root gate #3 also promoted out; G5 FC3 meta-loop
# closure PROMOTED OUT 2026-06-08 — see note below):
#   G4 pending_m07_budget_ceiling_enforced       -> BUDGET_CEILING_STANDING_PENDING
# G4 is STANDING pending — it additionally requires a separate user §8 decision
# (budget hard-ceiling ruling). G1 was promoted to the live gate
# tests/constitution_kernel_predicate_gate.rs, G2 to
# tests/constitution_single_admission_behavioral.rs, G3 to
# tests/constitution_predicate_zero_root_is_not_oracle.rs, conformance #3 to
# tests/constitution_all_canonical_writers_verify_trust_root.rs, and G5 to the
# live gate tests/constitution_fc3_meta_loop_closure.rs under the §8 token
# APPROVE-FC3-RUNTIME-VETO-AND-TRUSTROOT-REINIT (FC3 irreversible leg landed: the
# runtime Veto-AI clause-walker + the PASS-gated SANDBOX trust-root recompute +
# re-init now close the meta-loop, so both G5 observations flip GREEN).
