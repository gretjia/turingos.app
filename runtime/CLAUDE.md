# TuringOS v4 — CLAUDE.md (Claude Code adapter)

@AGENTS.md

This file is the Claude Code adapter. Cross-agent harness contract lives in
AGENTS.md; this file holds only Claude-Code-specific operating detail. If
duplicated, treat AGENTS.md as the shared router.

## 1. Identity & truth order

See `AGENTS.md §1`. If LATEST.md conflicts with ChainTape evidence, ChainTape
wins. If ChainTape contradicts constitution gates, stop.

## 2. Prime operating mode

Constitutional Harness Engineering (`AGENTS.md §4`). Required loop: constitution
gate → real run → debug → fix → rerun → audit → ship.

## 3. Risk class & STEP_B surfaces

See `AGENTS.md §5–§6`. STEP_B Trust Root files require per-atom architect §8.

## 4. Engineering rules

Required:
- `cargo check`
- `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
- `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`

Forbidden:
- `.env` commit
- hardcoded behavior parameter
- `f64` in money path
- memory-only canonical state
- shadow ledger source of truth
- dashboard-only source of truth

Money/economy paths must use integer math only.

Agent read views must be scoped, reconstructable, shielded. Do not expose raw
Lean stderr, raw autopsy, private diagnostics, benchmark leaks in ordinary
agent prompts.

Canonical IDs and shadow IDs must not be mixed.

No workaround closures: do not turn a failing gate into a skip, null pointer,
empty evidence path, or dashboard-only proof.

### Canonical FC1 invariant (preserved for tooling binding)

Externalized attempt count equality (per OBS_TB18R_INV1_NONLLM_TX_2026-05-07
clarification):

```
evaluator_reported_completed_llm_calls
=
  tool_dist.step + tool_dist.parse_fail + tool_dist.llm_err
```

This is the canonical LHS scope. The LHS must NOT use
`evaluator_reported_tx_count` (which inflates with architect-mandated non-LLM
admin scaffold). Each of `step` / `parse_fail` / `llm_err` corresponds to one
`r2_write_attempt_telemetry` call site — one externalized LLM-Lean cycle.

If this equality fails: HALT; do not continue benchmark; do not audit as pass.

## 5. Pre-action skill gates

Before drafting TB charter / dispatching G1 audit: `/constitution-landing-check`

Before drafting a charter that will touch `src/` or `scripts/`: check in-flight
PRs for path overlap (see `AGENTS.md §4.1`). One-liner, no new mechanism.

Before runner script that mutates handover/evidence/: `/runner-preflight`

Before writing new feedback_*.md: ask "what mechanism enforces this?"

After TB SHIPPED FINAL or audit rounds > 3: `/harness-reflect`

Before starting a grill session where answer vagueness or contradiction is
expected: `/grill-recursive`

Before calling `turingos generate` when the artifact is an HTML UI app:
`/spec-html-renderer`

Before any implementation / audit / "完成" turn at task Class ≥ 1: read
`OBLIGATIONS.md` and lead the turn with `Active obligations: OBL-001
(open), OBL-002 (satisfied), ... → next action`. User mid-flight debug
input is **input** to existing OBL, never replacement — replacement requires
explicit trigger phrase. See `AGENTS.md §16` + `skills/OBLIGATIONS_LEDGER.md`.

## 6. Audit boundary

See `AGENTS.md §9` (audit default — platform-agnostic clean-context audit) and
`AGENTS.md §14` (class-by-class cadence and verdict domain).

The clean-context audit (any capable platform — Claude / Codex / Antigravity /
…) is NOT a judge. Its legal output space:
`{NO-VIOLATION, VIOLATION-FOUND, RECONSTRUCTION-FAILURE, SECOND-SOURCE-DRIFT}`.
Subjective opinions are out-of-scope.

## 7. Read order for new session

Follow the canonical cold-start order in `AGENTS.md §2`. Claude-specific delta:
read this file (`CLAUDE.md`) first, then continue with that order. Optional
Claude memory lives at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (do not depend
on that path existing on other machines).

## 8. Handover discipline (Claude-specific)

Dynamic state belongs in `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` and
`handover/tracer_bullets/TB_LOG.tsv`. CLAUDE.md must not encode current ship
status, gate counts, HEADs, freeze details.

Claude memory files live in
`~/.claude/projects/-home-zephryj-projects-turingosv4/memory/`.
Memory is for recurring rules, surprises, mechanisms. Do not duplicate TB_LOG
facts into memory.

## 9. User context

The user is a solo researcher and vibe coder with limited programming background.

Default user-facing language: Chinese. Technical terms may remain English.

Prioritize:
- clear decisions
- explicit gates
- exact instructions for AI coder
- no fake certainty
- no ceremonial process
- tape-first implementation
- fast real-run feedback

Never hide behind process if the tape is wrong.

## 10. Execution liveness (Claude-specific)

实现 `AGENTS.md §4.2` 的 Claude-Code 特有操作细节（ADD per `AGENTS.md §2`
Layer 2——只补充 Claude 工具格式症状，不复述通用规则）。若某次工具调用格式
出错，导致其调用以**原始 XML 文本**显示在 transcript 中而非真正执行，须立即
自查、修正调用格式后重发——绝不把未执行的 raw-XML 调用当成已完成的工作。
