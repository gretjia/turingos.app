# TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX — TB ↔ Constitution Flowchart Mapping

> **ARCHIVAL DERIVED VIEW — not current authority.** Retained only as historical evidence. Current flowchart topology authority is `constitution.md` FC1 `455-509`, FC2 `571-660`, FC3 `826-870`, plus the active matrices that explicitly derive from those blocks.

**Authority**: architect directive 2026-05-02, ruling 9 of Part C ("Add TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md mapping future TBs to Flowchart 1/2/3").

## §1 Why this matrix exists

The lossless constitution integrated edition 2026-05-02 elevated three flowcharts from explanatory diagrams to **SHA256-anchored architectural contracts**. Each TB charter (current + future) must declare which flowchart element(s) it touches; deviation between code behavior and the four canonical hashes is now provably auditable.

This matrix is the cross-reference. It is updated at every TB ship.

## §4 Validation tests by flowchart

### 4.1 Flowchart 1 (runtime loop)

For any TB that touches the runtime loop, the following invariants must hold:

```text
1. Every externalized proposal lands in L4 (accepted) or L4.E (rejected).
   - No "third place" for failed proposals.
   - No accepted node without predicate-passing evidence.

2. Predicate evidence resolves from CAS.
   - L4 or L4.E entry → CID → CAS → evidence blob → sha256 verifies.

3. Dashboard is materialized view.
   - Dashboard is regeneratable from ChainTape + CAS alone.
   - Dashboard does not have authoritative state.

4. Predicate failure does not advance Q_t.
   - q_state.ledger_root unchanged on rejected proposals.
   - L4.E append is a separate ledger slot, not a Q_t mutation.
```

Reference: TB-7R 4-clause acceptance + 7-condition ship gate (`handover/audits/RECURSIVE_AUDIT_TB_7R_2026-05-02.md`).

### 4.2 Flowchart 2 (boot)

For any TB that touches boot or Q_0:

```text
1. Boot artifact exists and is replayable.
   - genesis_report.json (or successor) lives in run evidence dir.
   - Replay reconstructs Q_0 byte-exactly from the artifact.

2. on_init is the sole legal mint point.
   - No post-init mint may appear in any TypedTx variant.
   - MarketMakerBudget (when introduced TB-12+) is allocated AT on_init,
     consumed thereafter, never refilled by future mint.

3. TaskOpen / EscrowLock are observable from L4 (post-TB-7R).
   - Memory-only preseed is forbidden as production evidence.
```

Reference: TB-7R Atom C+D commit `392a516`; `handover/architect-insights/CONSTITUTION_ART_0_5_DRAFT_2026-04-26.md`.

### 4.3 Flowchart 3 (meta)

For any TB that touches the meta loop (logs / ArchitectAI / JudgeAI / re-init):

```text
1. EvidenceCapsule produced at session end.
   - Per Markov rule: latest capsule + constitution = default context.
   - Historical logs preserved in archive but not loaded by default.

2. No raw log fragment leaks into Agent prompt.
   - Per Art. III.1 屏蔽错误 + DECISION_LAMARCKIAN_AUTOPSY_BOLTZMANN.

3. Permission changes route through ArchitectAI → JudgeAI/VetoAI → canary.
   - Even Autopsy-suggested policy patches must traverse this loop.

4. Markov override (deep-history read) only on persistent-disease problems.
   - Override requires explicit reason + signature.
```

## §5 Update protocol

```text
1. Every new TB charter MUST add a row to §3 declaring which flowchart
   element(s) it touches. Missing declaration = reject before commit
   (per feedback_tb_phase_tag_required pattern, extended to flowcharts).

2. At TB ship, validation tests in §4 are checked for the touched flowcharts.
   Failing test = ship-gate violation.

3. If a TB touches no flowchart element (rare; e.g., pure docs TB), declare
   "—" across all three columns and explain in Notes.

4. This matrix is updated in the same commit as the TB ship.
   No "I'll update it later" — the matrix is part of the ship gate.

5. Flowchart hashes are immutable. If the constitution canonical flowcharts
   change, that is a Class 4 sudo event; this matrix is then re-rebased.
```

## §6 Status

```text
Created:               2026-05-02
Last TB ship:          TB-7R (commits 55680bb + 46716ae + 17d69de)
Next TB:               TB-8 (Minimal Payout / FinalizeRewardTx) — charter rewritten 2026-05-02
TB-1..TB-7R back-fill: from existing TB_LOG.tsv + commit history; mappings are
                       reconstructed, not original-author-declared.
                       Original authorship of these TBs predates this matrix.
TB-8 forward row:      declared in TB-8 charter rewrite 2026-05-02.
```

Reconstruction caveat for back-filled rows: TB-1..TB-7R rows in §3 are best-effort declarations based on what each TB demonstrably touched. Original TB charters did not declare flowchart traces. Future TBs will declare directly.
