## Current Snapshot (2026-06-09)

**Session**: 1.0 readiness via a systematic multi-tier real E2E + adversarial
campaign under the standing `/goal`, then closing the resulting Class-4 security
gap. `main` now at `7298b927` (Merge #340). THREE PRs landed this session:

- **#338** (`6649c684`, Class 2, zero pinned) — 1.0 product-flow hardening of
  `turingos generate`: honest delivery contract (post-delivery steps
  warn+anchor+exit-0, never retract a printed delivery; a genuine pre-delivery /
  structural failure still exits 2), entrypoint-aware structural gate
  (`.py`->PythonParses via `sanitized_runner`, `.html`->HtmlParses), spec-derived
  functional gate, C11 shielded retry-feedback, and a new read-only
  `turingos observe` (FC1/FC2/FC3 liveness + no-zombie + integer-VPPUT rollup).
  Includes the E2E-driven needle fixes. Clean-context 4-lens audit 4x PROCEED.
- **#339** (`09b3903`, Class 1) — operator-convenience VPPUT surfaced in
  `turingos tdma run`. **Honestly NOT** the canonical Lean-oracle H-VPPUT: it
  uses the deterministic stage judges, and the tdma git tape is not the
  runtime-L4 tape `reconstruct_vpput_from_tape` reads.
- **#340** (`7298b927`; trust-root commit `0585831b`; tag
  `v4-ratify-2026-06-09-siggap`, gretjia ED25519) — **Class-4 §8** closure of
  **OBS_AGENT_SIG_REPLAY_GAP**. §8 token
  `APPROVE-AGENT-SIG-INGRESS-FAILCLOSED-ALL-12`. ALL 12 agent economic TypedTx
  variants (Work/Verify/Challenge/TaskOpen/EscrowLock + CompleteSet*/MarketSeed/
  Cpmm*/BuyWithCoinRouter) are now signature-verified **FAIL-CLOSED** at
  `submit_agent_tx` ingress via a shared `verify_economic_agent_sig` helper (new
  `SubmitError::AgentManifestRequired`: no manifest -> reject) AND at replay
  Gate 4. 8 trust-root pins rehashed (sequencer.rs, verify.rs,
  chain_derived_run_facts.rs test-section, + 5 pinned test files). Closes the
  ingress vector for UNTRUSTED external agents (architect-confirmed 1.0 req).

**Architect decision (2026-06-09) — NON-FATAL functional gate**: the spec-derived
`RequiredTextPresent` check is best-effort (needle derived from fuzzy LLM prose,
wrong 4 ways across the E2E: filename / command / numeric / narrative-example).
Delivery is gated on the reliable STRUCTURAL scenarios ONLY; a functional miss is
delivered + recorded as an on-tape advisory + warned, never a hard reject. See
`test_run::delivery_verdict`.

**E2E campaign (5 tiers; real CLI + live LLM + top-level tape observer; no mocks)**:
- Simple E2E (HTML game / Python script) -> both OS-LIVE-DELIVERED.
- Tier-1 (long-horizon multi-turn resume / forced-retry / adversarial) — FC2
  multi-tick + resume + C11 relay + fail-closed all held; surfaced a trust-root
  CLI footgun (`init` told users to `cd` into the scaffold; fixed) and the needle
  false-negative (-> non-fatal gate).
- Tier-2 (multi-worker market resolution `--n-parallel-workers 3` / Lean-oracle
  `tdma --judge nesbitt`) — 3 workers admitted + winner settled; judge oracle
  fired + discriminated correctly (7/8 stages, last step rightly rejected).
- Tier-3 (100 synthetic Byzantine agents, zero-LLM, deterministic) — money
  conservation / ingress system-tx rejection / double-claim idempotency / DoS
  back-pressure / malformed fail-closed / 200-entry replay ALL held at scale;
  DEMONSTRATED the agent-sig ingress gap exploitable -> drove #340.
Full report: `handover/audits/E2E_1_0_READINESS_2026-06-09.md`.

**Gates at `main`**: `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` 479 bins / 0 failed;
`run_constitution_gates` total=**194** failed=0; matrix-drift 3/3. New gates this
session: `constitution_agent_sig_ingress_failclosed` (7 variants x 4 states,
triple-coupled), `constitution_e2e_1_0_product_flow`,
`no_false_pass_functional_scenario`, `adversarial_100_agent_scale` (7/7),
`tdma_verified_pput_micro_gate`.

**1.0 posture**: the core product flow (describe app -> delivered working code on
a constitutional tape) AND untrusted-agent ingress security are now closed.
**Remaining (architect / §8)**: **P2** distributable-binary trust-root (make
`generate`'s trust-root check cwd-independent / binary-embedded — Class-4, only
needed if shipping a standalone binary; the demo runs from the source root, and
`init`'s "Next steps" now reflects that); minor **P4** (audit-tape production
role naming, cross-backend `observe`/`verify chaintape` for the tdma git tape,
market `winner=` stdout line).

**Merge model (this session)**: with explicit architect authorization the agent
self-merges non-trust-root PRs (#339 agent-merged). Trust-root PRs still require a
user-signed `v4-ratify-*` tag (cryptographic, G-GUARD) before agent merge — that
is the one irreducibly-human step (#340 merged after the user signed the tag).
See `feedback_agent_merge_authorization`.

## Current Snapshot (2026-06-08)

**Session**: Agentic-OS roadmap S1–S6 — **every autonomously-shippable atom
SHIPPED + merged** under the standing `/goal` (continuous workflows, self-open +
self-merge PRs, constitution-bounded autonomy). 10 PRs landed #315–#324: M07
single-admission predicate gate (#315/#316), conformance sweep +5 bypasses
(#317), all-canonical-writers-verify-trust-root (#318), S6 verification redesign

memory (#322), S5 interop (#323), S3 economy observe-only boltzmann trace (#324).
Each = Class 0–2, non-vacuous mutation-proven gate, ZERO trust-root/pinned change
(unpinned-`#[path]`-submodule pattern), clean-context audit PROCEED. Workspace at
#324: `cargo test --workspace` 2696/0, `run_constitution_gates` total=184

user tokens** (FC3-irreversible, Tier-2-agent-writable-memory, budget-hard-ceiling,
capability-wallet-gating — packets in `handover/section8/`) **+ the multi-LLM-on-

ledger: `handover/reports/AGENTIC_OS_ROADMAP_S1_S6_FINAL_STATUS_2026-06-08.md` +
OBL-016 2026-06-08 progress block. The verification critique ("测试到底有没有用?")
was vindicated + addressed: enumerate-all-sites gates + mutation-proof + recurring
sweep + pinned≠wired (`feedback_single_site_gate_illusion`).

## Current Snapshot (2026-06-06)

**Session**: OBL-005 is now closed under the ratified no-zombie/no-drift
scope, while the Agentic OS pivot wave has landed through PR #309 and A03
KEEP-SRC-BOOT has consumed its Section-8 ratification as a focused boot
manifest gate. A03 status token: `A03_KEEP_SRC_BOOT_LANDED`. PR #284 keeps Market A/B G0 at
single-WorkTx-node/core-scope stage-2; PR #285 hardens source-tree commit
git-history closure; PR #286 binds any future final closure to a fresh
current-tree witness path; PR #287-#291 synchronize guard state, shared
web/CLI spec helpers, fresh ToolBench/Mind2Web liveness refs, and R-022
enforcement-log hygiene; PR #292 and PR #294 sync derived handover state;
PR #293 clarifies the OBL-010 historical G0 receipt vs current OBL-005
single-node/core-scope Market A/B runner boundary; PR #295 records the
Agentic OS pivot execution plan; PR #296-#306 land A04 through A14 substrate
and workload-boundary atoms; PR #307 fixes the final acceptance formatting /
trust-root / R-022 landing blocker; PR #308 syncs this derived handover view.
The user ratified `APPROVED-OBL005-NO-ZOMBIE-SCOPE` on 2026-06-06, and
`handover/audits/OBL005_FINAL_CLOSURE_WITNESS_2026-06-06.md` now closes
OBL-005 only for no-zombie/no-drift/no-unconstitutional-retained-substrate
proof. Current scoped status token: `OBL005_FINAL_CLOSURE_VERIFIED`.
Clean-context audit
`handover/audits/OBL005_NO_ZOMBIE_FINAL_CLOSURE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-06.md`
returns `NO-VIOLATION`. `handover/audits/OBLIGATION_COMPLETENESS_WITNESS_2026-06-06.md`
contains an exact `OBL-ALL-CLOSED` line for the obligation ledger. The later
A03 KEEP-SRC-BOOT landing keeps `src/boot.rs::verify_trust_root`
authoritative and does not claim wrapper-module migration, trust-root rehash,
or full Agentic OS plan completion.
PR #311 then repaired GitHub-main source-tree reachability for OBL-005 CI
bindings, and
`handover/audits/MAINLINE_BASELINE_SNAPSHOT_2026-06-06.md` records the current
read-only mainline baseline at `4af83627ef013b65a4764b4b9c4fffb93ea0a8ae`.

**Last synchronized base / snapshot source baseline**: `03564886` (PR #313 —
baseline snapshot semantics clarification on GitHub main, after PR #312
recorded the read-only snapshot from PR #311). This is not a self-updating
current-HEAD pointer; verify the current tip with `git rev-parse origin/main`.
This handover file is derived, not authority.

**Truth boundary**: this file is a derived handover view. If it conflicts with
`constitution.md`, ChainTape/CAS, deterministic replay, or executable gates,
trust those sources first.

Current state:

- `OBLIGATIONS.md` is **globally closed for Level=must obligations** after
  the 2026-06-06 scoped OBL-005 witness and the later A03/cache cleanup
  branch work. OBL-001 through OBL-015 are satisfied in the current ledger.
  The A03 closure is KEEP-SRC-BOOT only: no wrapper-module migration, no
  trust-root authority move, and no `build.rs` / `genesis_payload.toml`
  rehash.
- PR #245 through #307 hardened OBL-005 final-closure accounting and landed the
  Agentic OS pivot wave through A14 plus final acceptance cleanup: closure
  blocker inventory, replay-artifact GREEN checks, missing domain-closure
  blockers, source-tree fingerprint blockers, source-tree receipt identity, and
  source-receipt final-closure eligibility, plus fresh boot/replay, FC3,
  market/generate, Cybench, OSWorld, GPQA, Math, SWE-bench, ToolBench,
  WebArena, TDMA, Mind2Web, GAIA, and generate/market A-B closure-status
  evidence, plus two-sided YES/NO external market evidence, the single-sample
  benchmark overclaim guard, the closure-scope decision packet, and the
  executable closure-scope ratification guard plus derived handover/ledger
  guard-state synchronization, G0 historical/current-runner boundary guard,
  Market A/B single-node/core-scope stage-2 guard, source-tree commit
  git-history guard, fresh final closure witness binding guard, web/CLI shared
  spec runtime kernel guards, production liveness fresh-run binding,
  R-022 enforcement-log conflict-marker guard, OBL-010 historical/current G0
  boundary clarification, ChainTape-L4/TapeEvent/ExternalCall/AgentView/
  PredicateReceipt/Economy/ProjectionCache/Scheduler/UniversalWitness/OS-v0/
  WorkloadBoundary atoms, and the #307 R-022 same-file TRACE_MATRIX move
  preservation fix.
- PR #250 did **not** rewrite historical true-suite evidence. It makes future
  source-tree-bound current reruns produce closure-eligible source receipts
  when replay and source identity are green.
- Current reconciliation fixture binds all 21 rows to fresh current-source
  receipts from
  `obl005_fresh_boot_replay_20260604T143328Z` boot/CLI evidence,
  `obl005_ci_replay_cas_20260606T142221Z` replay/CAS evidence, and
  `obl005_fresh_fc3_20260604T150936Z` FC3 evidence, plus
  `obl005_fresh_market_20260604T235308Z` market evidence,
  `obl005_ci_generate_20260606T142742Z` generate/artifact evidence, and
  `obl005_ci_market_ab_20260606T143144Z` market A/B closure-status evidence,
  plus `obl005_fresh_cybench_20260604T164533Z` Cybench evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_osworld_20260604T171857Z` OSWorld evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_gpqa_20260604T183931Z` GPQA evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_math_20260604T191000Z` Math evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_swebench_20260604T192100Z` SWE-bench evidence,
  `obl005_ci_toolbench_20260606T143903Z` ToolBench evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_webarena_20260604T200738Z` WebArena evidence,
  `obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T203708Z` TDMA evidence,
  `obl005_ci_mind2web_20260606T143633Z` Mind2Web evidence, and
  `obl005_fresh_gaia_20260604T213500Z` GAIA evidence:
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false=0`,
  `source_tree_fingerprint_missing=0`,
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing=0`,
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false=14`,
  `benchmark_capability_not_solved=10`,
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_missing=0`, and
  `market_no_or_short_side_missing=0`. The remaining domain/benchmark rows
  are capability-pending annotations, not OBL-005 no-zombie closure blockers.
- Post-#310 CI reachability repair on 2026-06-06: GitHub CI showed that some
  final-closure bindings cited source-tree commits that existed in the local
  object store but were not reachable from GitHub `main`. The follow-up repair
  changes the source-tree guard from local `cat-file` presence to
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit> HEAD`, then rebinds
  generate/artifact, replay/CAS, Market A/B, Mind2Web, and ToolBench rows to
  fresh `e81c8a968c9b00723c2b4cd015368e3eb70dc58c` evidence roots:
  `obl005_ci_generate_20260606T142742Z`,
  `obl005_ci_replay_cas_20260606T142221Z`,
  `obl005_ci_market_ab_20260606T143144Z`,
  `obl005_ci_mind2web_20260606T143633Z`, and
  `obl005_ci_toolbench_20260606T143903Z`. This repair does not rewrite
  historical evidence, does not claim A03 runtime implementation, and preserves
  benchmark/domain failures as capability-pending annotations. Clean-context
  repair audit
  `handover/audits/OBL005_CI_SOURCE_TREE_REACHABILITY_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-06.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`; its evidence-root tracking finding was resolved by
  explicitly staging all five new roots (`git ls-files` returned 162 files).
- Mainline baseline snapshot on 2026-06-06: local branch
  `codex/mainline-baseline-snapshot` was created from `origin/main` at
  `4af83627ef013b65a4764b4b9c4fffb93ea0a8ae` after PR #311 merged. GitHub
  checks for PR #311 were green, `OBLIGATIONS.md` reported
  `OBL-ALL-CLOSED`, the reconciliation fixture reported
  `OBL005_FINAL_CLOSURE_VERIFIED`, and `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`
  passed locally with `[k-1-5] total=167 failed=0`. Snapshot record:
  `handover/audits/MAINLINE_BASELINE_SNAPSHOT_2026-06-06.md`. This is a
  read-only derived-view sync and still does not authorize or implement A03
  runtime work.
- Class 0 scope note added 2026-06-05:
  `handover/directives/2026-06-05_OBL005_CLOSURE_SCOPE_DECISION_PACKET.md`
  records the closure-scope decision fork. The user selected the recommended
  no-zombie/no-drift closure scope with `APPROVED-OBL005-NO-ZOMBIE-SCOPE`,
  with benchmark/domain failures kept as honest capability-pending facts.
- Class 2 guard added by PR #277: `tests/constitution_obl005_final_closure_witness.rs`
  now requires the scope packet, the explicit ratification phrase, and
  no-final-closure language before any later final witness can proceed. The
  2026-06-06 fresh witness consumes that guard under the exact user phrase.
- Class 2 source-tree commit guard added by PR #285:
  `tests/constitution_true_suite_evidence_reconciliation.rs::final_closure_source_tree_commits_must_exist_in_git_history`
  prevents any future final closure from citing source-tree commits absent from
  git history unless rows remain non-closing with explicit blockers. This is a
  guard only; it does not close OBL-005.
- Class 2 fresh final closure witness guard added by PR #286:
  `tests/fixtures/liveness/true_suite_evidence_reconciliation.toml` declares
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_path =
  "handover/audits/OBL005_FINAL_CLOSURE_WITNESS_2026-06-06.md"`, and
  `tests/constitution_true_suite_evidence_reconciliation.rs::final_closure_claim_requires_fresh_current_tree_witness_binding`
  requires `final_closure_claimed=true` to bind a fresh current-tree
  witness through `fresh_final_closure_witness_path`. The historical 2026-05-27
  witness remains immutable history, not reusable current closure authority. The
  PR #286 guard landed at `e13fb9d5`; the 2026-06-06 witness is now the current
  binding.
- Class 2 guard-state sync added by PR #287:
  `tests/constitution_obl005_final_closure_witness.rs` keeps the derived
  handover/ledger guard language aligned with the fresh witness and scope
  ratification gates. This is a guard only and does not close OBL-005.
- Class 2 web/CLI spec-kernel sharing added by PR #288 and PR #289:
  the web spec entry and CLI spec path now share the same runtime prompt/env
  helper surface, preserving one production kernel with different user entries.
  This supports the "web and CLI are entrances, not two TuringOSes" boundary.
- Class 2 production-liveness fresh-ref binding added by PR #290:
  `tests/constitution_production_module_liveness.rs::production_group_domain_evidence_uses_reconciled_fresh_runs`
  prevents active production ToolBench/Mind2Web liveness groups from drifting
  away from the reconciled fresh true-suite refs
  `obl005_fresh_toolbench_20260604T224409Z` and
  `obl005_fresh_mind2web_20260604T224409Z`.
- Class 2 R-022 enforcement-log guard added by PR #291:
  `tests/constitution_rules_ci_mirror.rs::enforcement_log_has_no_conflict_markers`
  prevents committed `rules/enforcement.log` conflict markers from surviving
  constitution gates. This is a hygiene guard only and does not close OBL-005.
- Current-binary boundary added by PR #293 on 2026-06-05: OBL-010's 11/11 `g0run5`
  capability receipt is historical evidence anchored to commit `418d8a7d`.
  Current `src/bin/g0_market_activation_current_kernel.rs` was deliberately
  narrowed by PR #258 / commit `7b12e9f1` into the OBL-005 Market A/B
  single-node/core-scope runner. Do not cite the current retained binary as
  current c4/c5/c10/c11 proof without fresh multi-node replay evidence.
- Current blocker audit on 2026-06-05 re-derived the active reconciliation
  counts from `tests/fixtures/liveness/true_suite_evidence_reconciliation.toml`:
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing=21`,
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false=14`,
  `benchmark_capability_not_solved=10`, and zero source/tree/domain-missing or
  market-NO blockers. Focused gates
  `constitution_production_module_liveness`,
  `constitution_true_suite_evidence_reconciliation`, and
  `constitution_obl005_final_closure_witness` passed locally. Headless AGY and
  Claude Sonnet read-only audits found no unregistered zombie in the inspected
  liveness/reconciliation gates; both agree final OBL-005 closure is not allowed
  without explicit scope ratification and a fresh current-tree final witness.
- Agentic OS pivot landing status on 2026-06-06: PR #296 A04, #297 A05,
  #298 A06, #299 A07, #300 A08, #301 A09, #302 A10, #303 A11, #304 A12,
  #305 A13, and #306 A14 merged through PR-only workflow; #307 then fixed the
  post-A14 final acceptance blocker (`cargo fmt --check` drift), rehashed only
  the two affected trust-root pins, and fixed R-022 so same-file
  `TRACE_MATRIX` moves are not false-positive removals. #307 verification:
  GitHub Constitution gate suite, Feature freeze check, `r022_check`, and
  sidecar-contamination check all passed; local evidence included
  `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check`, `cargo check --workspace`,
  `cargo test -j1 --workspace --no-fail-fast`, focused R-022/matrix/rules/
  hygiene tests, and `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`
  (`[k-1-5] total=167 failed=0`). Clean-context AGY witness returned
  `NO-VIOLATION` in
  `handover/audits/FINAL_ACCEPTANCE_FORMAT_TRUSTROOT_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-06.md`.
  The later 2026-06-06 OBL-005 closure does not claim A03 runtime
  implementation, benchmark capability closure, or full Agentic OS plan
  completion.
- A03 boundary note: `handover/directives/2026-06-05_A03_BOOT_TRUST_ROOT_MANIFEST_PREFLIGHT_AND_SECTION8_REQUEST.md`
  was a preflight/Section-8 packet; on 2026-06-06 the user supplied the exact
  ratification phrase `APPROVE-A03-SECTION8-KEEP-SRC-BOOT`. The landed A03
  marker is `A03_KEEP_SRC_BOOT_LANDED`. The implementation keeps live boot
  trust-root authority at `src/boot.rs::verify_trust_root`, uses the existing
  A13 public CLI hook `src/bin/turingos/cmd_boot.rs`, and adds the focused
  gate `tests/constitution_tc_boot_trust_root_manifest.rs`. No
  `src/runtime/boot_trust_root_manifest.rs` wrapper, `build.rs` edit,
  `genesis_payload.toml` rehash, or `src/main.rs` boot-call edit is part of
  this A03 landing.
- Fresh deterministic evidence added this session: `boot_cli_current_kernel_fresh`
  and `replay_cas_tamper_repair_current` now point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_boot_replay_20260604T143328Z/`.
  Both receipts are `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `024dfd2d75817f7c0e52004fd3fca8122e9981d9`; replay/CAS still keeps its
  domain-closure-missing blocker and all rows still require a fresh final
  closure witness.
- Fresh FC3 evidence added this session: `fc3_governance_reinit_fresh` and
  `memory_feedback_reinit` now point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_fc3_20260604T150936Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `5a2c74c46c9060256410c07a4e79ee2b0331212b`; both rows still require a
  fresh final closure witness. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_FC3_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION` for the Class 2 reconciliation/evidence update.
- Fresh market evidence added this session: `market_external_agent_fresh` and
  `market_economy_polymarket` now point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_market_20260604T235308Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `ff5d109e3ae17a0f1ca929398d04504d4da8e610`, two role-separated external LLM
  market participants, signed YES+NO `BuyWithCoinRouterTx` evidence
  (`buy_yes_count=1`, `buy_no_count=1`, `no_side_market_action_txs=1`), exactly
  one WorkTx for the task reward path (`work_tx_count_for_task=1`), packaged
  restore replay artifacts, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`, `missing=[]`, and replay/restore
  indicators green. This removes the market rows'
  `market_no_or_short_side_missing` and `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`
  blockers while deliberately keeping `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`.
  Clean-context AGY witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_TWO_SIDED_MARKET_EXTERNAL_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-05.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION` before PR #274 merged. No final OBL-005 closure is
  claimed.
- Fresh market A/B closure-status evidence merged by PR #272:
  `market_ab_performance_fresh` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_market_ab_20260604T232500Z/`.
  The full-system layer is `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT` with `missing=[]`, and the domain
  receipt is scoped to
  `market_ab_candidate_only_g0_core_conditions_1_2_3_6_7_8_9`. The G0 receipt
  proves YES+NO trades (`buy_yes_count=1`, `buy_no_count=1`), one WorkTx node,
  one ChallengeTx short side, price movement, structural shielding, stage-2
  EventResolve observation, and green ChainTape replay. It explicitly records
  c4/c5 priced-DAG branching and c10/c11 reward-claim settlement closure as
  constrained/stage-2 under the current one-rewardable-WorkTx task escrow
  kernel shape; no c1-11 final closure is claimed. The row now keeps
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false` and
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`, not a missing-domain-receipt blocker.
  Verification passed: focused generate/market/reconciliation/package tests,
  constitution matrix drift, constitution gates (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`),
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`, strict secret scan, and GitHub checks
  on PR #272. Clean-context AGY witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_GENERATE_MARKETAB_CLOSURE_STATUS_AGY_WITNESS_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh GPQA source evidence prepared on the current branch:
  `gpqa_science_reasoning` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_gpqa_20260604T183931Z/`.
  The source receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `7b12e9f1fc6469682af6d5f4e8a2cba18ba0c0d2`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, green replay indicators, and 4 packaged evidence stores. The
  model result is honestly recorded as `correct_with_rationale` with
  `answer_correct=true`, but the domain manifest remains
  `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` and `final_closure_possible=false`.
  The reconciliation manifest now points only the `gpqa_science_reasoning`
  broad-family row at this fresh run, reducing
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 9 to 8 while deliberately keeping `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`
  and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. Verification passed: real current
  runner through `scripts/run_true_suite_broad_agi_batch.sh --execute-installed
  --run-id obl005_fresh_gpqa_20260604T183931Z --runners
  gpqa_science_reasoning_fresh`, focused reconciliation/final-closure/
  realworld/matrix tests, and AGY blocker-selection advisory `VALID`. This
  does not claim final closure. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_GPQA_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh Math source evidence prepared on the current branch:
  `math_formal_proof` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_math_20260604T191000Z/`.
  The source receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `70330599725b779c4e6e8479d5e8db9e05d83069`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, green replay indicators, and 4 packaged evidence stores. The
  model result is honestly recorded as `correct_with_rationale` with
  `answer_correct=true`, but the domain manifest remains
  `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` and `final_closure_possible=false`.
  The reconciliation manifest now points only the `math_formal_proof`
  broad-family row at this fresh run, reducing
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 8 to 7 while deliberately keeping `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`
  and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. This single-sample correct result
  is a capability signal, not a domain-closure proof. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_MATH_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh SWE-bench source evidence prepared on the current branch:
  `swebench_live_coding_repair_fresh` and `swebench_live_coding_repair` now
  point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_swebench_20260604T192100Z/`.
  The source receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `9ed91421378da1f083ee7cf8e985e5eeda5ee6e9`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, green replay indicators, and 4 packaged evidence stores. The
  model result is honestly recorded as `repair_patch_structurally_plausible`
  with `patch_structurally_plausible=true`, but the domain manifest remains
  `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` and `final_closure_possible=false`.
  The reconciliation manifest now points both the coverage-task row and the
  broad-family row at this fresh run, reducing
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 7 to 5 while deliberately keeping `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`,
  `benchmark_capability_not_solved`, and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`.
  This does not claim final closure. Verification passed, including
  `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`) and
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_SWEBENCH_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh ToolBench source evidence initially prepared in this session:
  `toolbench_api_tool_use` first pointed at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_toolbench_20260604T194611Z/`.
  The source receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `15c3477586191199f8dbe693e47441595dc73a63`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, green replay indicators, and 4 packaged evidence stores. The
  model result is honestly recorded as `tool_selection_mismatch` with
  `exact_match=false`, and the ToolBench domain manifest still omits
  `final_closure_possible`, so the reconciliation manifest now points only the
  `toolbench_api_tool_use` broad-family row at this fresh run, reducing
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 5 to 4 while deliberately keeping
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_missing`, `benchmark_capability_not_solved`,
  and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. This initial receipt does not
  claim final closure and is superseded for active production-liveness refs by
  PR #290's reconciled fresh ToolBench run `obl005_fresh_toolbench_20260604T224409Z`.
  Verification passed, including `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`
  (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`) and
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_TOOLBENCH_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh WebArena source evidence prepared on the current branch:
  `webarena_web_agent` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_webarena_20260604T200738Z/`.
  The source receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `e1ad26dc9260b219e8c328ac2543c766469418f2`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, green replay indicators, and 4 packaged evidence stores. The
  model result is honestly recorded as `browser_task_answer_mismatch` with
  `answer_correct=false`, and the WebArena domain manifest remains
  `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` and `final_closure_possible=false`,
  so the reconciliation manifest now points only the `webarena_web_agent`
  broad-family row at this fresh run, reducing
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 4 to 3 while deliberately keeping `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`,
  `benchmark_capability_not_solved`, and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`.
  This does not claim final closure. Verification passed, including
  `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`) and
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_WEBARENA_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`, including the WorkTx/escrow boundary check that no
  multi-node priced-DAG reward settlement is claimed.
- Fresh TDMA source evidence prepared on the current branch:
  `tdma_real_proof_fresh` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T203708Z/`.
  The TDMA child runner no longer pre-packages `tdma_tape.git`; the shared
  true-suite packager owns tarball creation. The fresh receipt is
  `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `bb0a29e166aa0db4c7635985a567e12b0a5830b9`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, `tdma_replay_report.ok=true`, `stages_completed=5/5`, packaged
  TDMA/runtime/CAS stores, and green restore replay indicators. The TDMA domain
  manifest remains `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` and
  `final_closure_possible=false`, so the reconciliation manifest reduces
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 3 to 2 while deliberately keeping `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`
  and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. Verification passed, including
  `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`) and
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_TDMA_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`. This does not claim final closure.
- Fresh Mind2Web source evidence added on main by PR #265:
  `mind2web_open_web` initially pointed at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_mind2web_20260604T210300Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `cd4c9e832dd7d213fabc61dba1c8e57a1b6c6544`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, admitted WorkTx, packaged CAS/runtime stores, green
  replay/restore indicators, and FC1/FC2/FC3 full-system rows. The model
  result remains `browser_action_mismatch`, and the Mind2Web domain manifest
  still omits `final_closure_possible`, so the reconciliation manifest reduces
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 2 to 1 while deliberately keeping
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_missing`, `benchmark_capability_not_solved`,
  and `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. This initial receipt does not
  claim final closure and is superseded for active production-liveness refs by
  PR #290's reconciled fresh Mind2Web run `obl005_fresh_mind2web_20260604T224409Z`.
- Fresh GAIA source evidence added by PR #267:
  `gaia_general_assistant` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_gaia_20260604T213500Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `90cec268a908f39a93eceb888af453e07f328b24`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, admitted WorkTx, packaged CAS/runtime stores, green
  replay/restore indicators, and FC1/FC2/FC3 full-system rows. The model
  result remains `incorrect_with_rationale`, and the GAIA domain manifest
  remains `closure_scope=domain_adapter_smoke_only` with
  `final_closure_possible=false`, so the reconciliation manifest reduces
  `source_receipt_final_closure_false` and `source_tree_fingerprint_missing`
  from 1 to 0 while deliberately keeping
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`, `benchmark_capability_not_solved`, and
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`. Verification passed: real runner,
  focused GAIA/reconciliation/production-liveness/final-closure/matrix tests,
  local secret scan, `git diff --check`, constitution gates
  (`[k-1-5] total=165 failed=0`), and `cargo test --workspace
  --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Codex witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_GAIA_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`. This does not claim final closure.
- Fresh generate/artifact closure-status evidence merged by PR #272:
  `generate_artifact_chain_fresh` now points at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_generate_20260604T232500Z/`.
  The provider-backed spec/generate run records
  `closure_scope=generate_artifact_chain_current_kernel`,
  `full_system_participation_required=true`, `final_closure_possible=true`,
  `family_id=generate_artifact_chain`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`, admitted WorkTx +
  MarketSeed, packaged CAS/runtime/TDMA stores, and restore replay indicators
  green. The row now keeps only `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`; the old
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_missing` blocker is removed. No final OBL-005
  closure is claimed.
  Clean-context AGY witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_GENERATE_MARKETAB_CLOSURE_STATUS_AGY_WITNESS_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- Fresh Cybench source evidence prepared and audited on the current branch:
  `cybench_security_sandbox_fresh` and `cybench_security_sandbox` now point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_cybench_20260604T164533Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `0f38026e4d03177ad4b6641086e9f1e98f751e8b`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, admitted WorkTx, packaged evidence stores, and green
  replay/restore indicators. The model result remains
  `safe_action_mismatch`, so both Cybench rows deliberately keep
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`, `benchmark_capability_not_solved`, and
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`; no final closure is claimed.
  Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_CYBENCH_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION` for the Class 2 reconciliation/evidence update.
- Fresh OSWorld source evidence prepared and audited on the current branch:
  `osworld_computer_use_fresh` and `osworld_computer_use` now point at
  `handover/evidence/true_suite/obl005_fresh_osworld_20260604T171857Z/`.
  The receipt is `final_closure_possible=true` with source commit
  `1254212e10afe939b466d8404889106383d9bdb8`, `FULL_SYSTEM_LIT`,
  `missing=[]`, admitted WorkTx, packaged evidence stores, and green
  replay/restore indicators. The model result remains
  `sandbox_action_mismatch`, so both OSWorld rows deliberately keep
  `domain_receipt_final_closure_false`, `benchmark_capability_not_solved`, and
  `fresh_final_closure_witness_missing`; no final closure is claimed.
  Verification passed: real runner, focused OSWorld/reconciliation/
  final-closure/matrix tests, local secret/raw-response scan, `git diff
  --check`, constitution gates (`[k-1-5] total=164 failed=0`), and
  `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Clean-context Claude witness
  `handover/audits/OBL005_FRESH_OSWORLD_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md`
  returned `NO-VIOLATION`.
- WorkTx/escrow boundary: `constitution.md` does not explicitly state a
  WorkTx-accept uniqueness rule for one rewardable WorkTx per task escrow.
  Current kernel admission allows multiple WorkTxs for the same task; TB-8
  single-solver settlement/claim sweeping is what prevents multiple same-task
  full escrow payouts. Current market liveness stays single-WorkTx-node with
  multi-agent YES/NO router-side activity.
- Current worktree note: successful TDMA evidence
  `obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T203708Z` is already bound in the reconciliation
  manifest. Do not treat local failed/intermediate or superseded evidence
  directories as GREEN evidence:
  `obl005_fresh_generate_20260604T160500Z`,
  `obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T190500Z`,
  `obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T203106Z`,
  `obl005_fresh_tdma_20260604T203504Z`,
  `obl005_fresh_market_ab_20260604T174500Z`, and
  `obl005_fresh_market_ab_20260604T175726Z`, plus the superseded local
  ToolBench run `obl005_fresh_toolbench_20260604T194504Z`.

- A03 KEEP-SRC-BOOT is consumed and landed as `A03_KEEP_SRC_BOOT_LANDED`.
  Do not start wrapper-module migration, TC-002 deferral extraction,
  trust-root rehash, or boot authority relocation unless the architect/user
  gives a new exact A03/TC-002 Section-8 phrase.
- OBL-005 is closed only under the ratified no-zombie scope. Keep
  benchmark/domain failures as capability-pending facts unless a separate
  capability/domain witness closes them.

`src/state/sequencer.rs`, `src/bus.rs`, `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs`,
`constitution.md`, `genesis_payload.toml`, `src/runtime/mod.rs` export,
no new CAS `ObjectType`, no provider abstraction layer.

### TB-STRESS-PHASE-2 (3 PRs merged 2026-05-23)

Adversarial 10-test battery on top of Phase E + TB-SOFTWARE-3-0.

| Atom | PR | Class | What |
|------|----|----|----|
| STRESS-0 | #129 | 0+1 | Charter + §8 + 10 runner scripts under `scripts/stress/` |
| STRESS-1..10 | #131 | 1+2 | Execution evidence + runner robustness fixes |
| STRESS-SHIP | #132 | 0 | Aggregate ship report + cumulative audits |

**Final tally**: 8 PASS / 1 PARTIAL (ST-04) / 1 NOT-EXECUTED (ST-08) / 0 FAIL.

Substantive finding (ST-04 PARTIAL): S2's `write_snapshot` VERIFIED writing
418-byte capsules with schema_id `turingos-web-grill-session-snapshot-v1`
to per-session CAS. Multi-turn resume blocked by upstream triage promotion
guard requiring `PromptPromotionReceipt` — workspace bootstrap dependency,
NOT S2 defect. Production guard correctly fail-closes on unconfigured
workspaces.

### Memory updates from this session

- `feedback_defer_abstraction_until_second_impl` — don't propose
  ChatProvider/ModelCallReceipt-style framework before 2nd concrete impl
  lands. Rename to generic naming OK; abstraction layer deferred.
- `feedback_git_hygiene_no_bulk_ops` — forbidden: `git stash -u`, `git add -A`;
  default execution base = fresh worktree from origin/main.
- `feedback_conservative_error_semantics` — empty IS normal (`Ok(SpecPending)`,
  not `Err(EmptySession)`); HTTP failures use 502/500, not 200-with-warning.

## Pre-session #59 snapshot (for forensic continuity)

**Session**: #58 close, 2026-05-21 (late evening).

**State**: P7.z + Boundary-Ratification-Hygiene remain complete; session
#58 shipped three increments:
1. **Plan v7 — MiniF2F partial recovery** (PR #82/#83/#84 + hotfix as `cff03a28`):
   restored `lean_market` binary (`experiments/minif2f_v4/`, separate
   Cargo workspace) and promoted `batch_orchestrator.rs` to `src/runtime/`.
   Tier 3 deleted files remain unrestored per architect's strict
   no-innovation directive.
2. **R-022 hook architectural fix** (PR #88 `1cfad1a4` + PR #89 `865b4c14`):
   moved the TRACE_MATRIX backlink check from `pre-commit.r022` to a new
   `commit-msg.r022` hook (gives the in-flight commit message regardless
   of `-m`/`-F`/interactive), fixing the COMMIT_EDITMSG read footgun
   discovered during the Plan v7 hotfix. Constitution gate test parity
   updated alongside.
3. **Generative HTML kernel-integrity probe + Software 3.0 audit** (PR #91,
   branch `claude/generative-html-kernel-probe-20260522`): surfaced 5 real
   kernel bugs in `src/web/spec.rs` + `src/web/generate.rs` (2 LANDED via
   parallel sessions with tests; 2 in tree; 1 forward-bound). Software 3.0
   conformance: 3 PASS / 6 WARN / 2 FAIL (rubric C1-C11). FAIL = C8 no
   cross-session agent memory + C10 no generative HTML IR. See
   [handover/research/generative_html_kernel_integrity_2026-05-22/synthesis/REPORT.md](../research/generative_html_kernel_integrity_2026-05-22/synthesis/REPORT.md).

There is no active charter PR in flight at this handover.

**Archive**: sessions #1-#54 remain at
`handover/ai-direct/LATEST_ARCHIVE_PRE_2026-05-20_sessions_1_to_54.md`.
Session #56 audit/remediation records live under `handover/audits/`.

## What Changed In PR #78

PR #78 deliberately did **not** start the full v2.0 predicate layer. It shipped
the smaller transition framework: boundary facts, §8 ratification, process
hygiene, truthfulness hygiene, and meaning fixtures.

Load-bearing artifacts:

- `docs/architecture/FC_REAL_WORLD_BOUNDARY.md`
  - Class 0 fact record for FC1/FC2/FC3 real-world boundaries.
  - Names the four architect decisions: Art. 0.4 path, hermetic mechanism,
    predicate process locality, and LLM call topology.
- `handover/directives/2026-05-21_FC_BOUNDARY_RATIFICATION_DIRECTIVE.md`
  - Ratifies the boundary choices without auto-authorizing sequencer,
    typed-tx, trust-root, or signing-payload implementation.
- `handover/evidence/sandbox_boundary_baseline_2026-05-21.md`
  - Before-state evidence for naked shell-out, weak sandbox claims, and stale
    boundary facts.
- `src/sdk/sanitized_runner.rs`
  - `env_clear`, env allowlist, explicit cwd, stdout/stderr capture, timeout
    kill, argv/cwd/allowed-env/exit/timed-out evidence.
  - `NetworkPolicyClaim::NotEnforced`; phase 0 does not claim `DenyAll`.
- Product shell-out wiring through the sanitized runner.
- P7.z truthfulness hygiene:
  - prompt hash binds canonical provider request bytes;
  - raw-output CID uses provider response bytes;
  - `world_head_unchanged` is observed rather than production-literal;
  - offline/sandbox/browser wording is downgraded to what the code can prove.
- Real-world meaning fixtures:
  - compile failure,
  - regression two-phase,
  - preview DOM contract rather than screenshot oracle,
  - privacy secret-env non-leak,
  - ambiguous requirement hold/non-accept.

Non-claim: TuringOS still does **not** have OS-level hermetic/no-network
sandboxing. The shipped claim is production shell-out process hygiene.

    read footgun). Postmortem: `handover/architect-insights/R022_HOOK_FIX_2026-05-22.md`.
  - PR #89 at `865b4c14` — constitution gate parity update
    (`l8_pre_commit_hook_chains_k_harden_2_block` flipped + 2 new
    gate tests bind the new architecture).

Migration: existing clones must re-run `bash scripts/install_hooks.sh`
to pick up the new `commit-msg` symlink. Idempotent.

P7.z produced the CAS-backed product evidence chain:

```text
SpecCapsule
  -> GenerationAttemptCapsule
  -> ArtifactBundleManifest
      -> PreviewRunCapsule
      -> TestRunCapsule
      -> GenerateRejectionCapsule (L4.E)
      -> BuildSessionView (derived)
      -> offline replay/spec audit
```

PR #78 then tightened how the project talks about that chain: no fake
hermetic claim, no fake `DenyAll`, no literal world-head self-report, no
dashboard/screenshot/LLM-reviewer truth claim.

---

## Active Non-Claims

- Do not claim complete v2.0 predicate layer.
- Do not claim OS-level hermetic sandbox.
- Do not claim runtime network denial.
- Do not treat screenshots, dashboards, cache, web sessions, or LLM reviews as
  acceptance truth.
- Do not treat MiniF2F as a live root-workspace package; the root workspace
  excludes it. Plan v7 (2026-05-21) restored a partial subset:
  `experiments/minif2f_v4/` is again a separate Cargo workspace housing the
  `lean_market` binary only (Tier 1), and `batch_orchestrator.rs` was
  promoted to `src/runtime/` (Tier 2). All other deleted MiniF2F files
  (Tier 3) remain unrestored.

Allowed wording:

```text
TuringOS has shipped process hygiene for production shell-outs: env allowlist,
explicit cwd, timeout, stdout/stderr capture, and unified runner wiring. This
is not OS-level hermetic/no-network sandboxing.
```

---

## Recommended Next Work

Original 3 options (session #57):

1. Decide whether the next charter is OS-level sandbox phase 1, P7.z
   truthfulness follow-up, or a tiny replayable-decision smoke test.
2. If choosing sandbox phase 1, make the mechanism explicit first:
   process-only, bwrap/unshare/seccomp, or VM/Wasmtime. Do not smuggle this
   into a generic "predicate layer" task.
3. If choosing replayable decision, do not call it the predicate layer yet.
   Keep it to deterministic boolean decision record/replay with no schema
   catalog, oracle, cooldown, or predicate taxonomy.

Additional charters surfaced by session #58 generative HTML probe + Software 3.0 audit
(detail in [synthesis/REPORT.md §6](../research/generative_html_kernel_integrity_2026-05-22/synthesis/REPORT.md)):

4. **Charter A — Generative HTML IR** (closes C10 FAIL, highest-impact). Define
   `GenerativeHtmlIr` JSON schema → generate emits IR first then renders → IR CID into
   `GenerationAttemptCapsule` tail-additive → new `ir_to_html` renderer + test gate.
   Class 2-3. Orthogonal to all 3 options above. Gives TuringOS a unique formally
   auditable + content-addressed IR no commercial comparator has.
5. **Charter B — Web Driven-Mode default + generate prompt hash** (closes C1/C2/C9 WARN).
   Class 1-2. Supersedes P7.z truthfulness on the generate-prompt-hash dimension.
6. **Charter C — Layered eval + sandbox static analysis** (closes C6/C11 WARN + BUG-5
   verifier no fetch detection + BUG-6 new W8 `JsSyntaxValid` gate). Class 2.
   Complementary to OS sandbox phase 1.
7. **Follow-up parallel sessions** for BUG-3a (`generate.rs` step 4b error propagation
   matching spec.rs) + BUG-3b (env allowlist regression test) — both Class 1-2.
