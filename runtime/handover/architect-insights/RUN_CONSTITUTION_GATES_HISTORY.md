# RUN_CONSTITUTION_GATES_HISTORY.md

## Archive of Pre-K-1.5 Hand-Curated Gate Runner

This document contains the original 892-line `scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` 
prior to K-1.5 refactoring (2026-05-20). It preserves the full amendment history 
and dated comments that recorded the rationale for each of the 67 constitutional 
gates.

The original runner used a hard-coded GATES array with inline architecture. K-1.5 
extracts this authority into a structured TOML manifest (`scripts/constitution_gates.manifest.toml`) 
and replaces the hand-curated runner with an auto-discovery mechanism that:

1. Discovers gates from test files (`tests/constitution_*.rs`)
2. Cross-checks against the manifest
3. Fails the build if discovered gates ≠ manifest gates

This ensures gates cannot drift silently and gates added to the codebase MUST 
be explicitly authorized in the manifest before CI passes.

The full original content with all amendment comments follows:
