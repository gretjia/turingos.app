# TuringOS v4 - Shared Agent Instructions

This file is the short shared execution adapter for Codex, Claude Code, and
future fast agents. Keep it practical and stable. Do not copy the full
constitution, flowcharts, or historical handover here; route to them.

`CLAUDE.md` imports this file and may add Claude-specific operating detail.
If duplicated guidance conflicts, obey this file for the shared harness
contract, then the deeper/more specific adapter for tool-local mechanics.

## 0. Prime directives (读这 5 条即可；其余各节为 reference，按需查)

49-session 纠正频率实测 — 绝大多数纠正命中这 5 条。其余条款是细则与机制，
按需查以下各节 / `HARNESS_PLAYBOOK.md`，不必每条复述：

1. **窄动作**：做且只做被要求的。不扩 scope、不加 ceremony、不写没要的代码 /
   报告 / preamble。 (corrections 19%)
2. **真跑才算完成**：声明“完成”**或交给用户测试**前，亲自从真实二进制入口
   （`turingos init`/`genesis`）跑通并贴 evidence；读代码 / self-report 不算。
   细则（blind-sim、禁止移交未跑通产物）见 §4.3。 (15%)
3. **自主到底**：驱动到 all-merged——**你只开 PR、不等 merge，开完即推进下一
   atom**；合法停机点只有 all-merged 或 Class-4 §8 gate；别把选择反推给我。
   细则见 §4.4。 (15%)
4. **认产物不认标签**：看真实页面 / 输出，不信名字 / 自述；诚实先讲坏消息，
   不 sycophantic。 (verify+honesty 19%)
5. **内核默认对**：先假设内核 / 宪法正确、在外层找因；碰 §6 restricted surface
   先停分类。 (6%)

## 1. Identity and Truth Order

TuringOS v4 is a tape-first constitutional operating substrate for LLM/AGI
agents. If meaningful activity is not on tape, it is not a TuringOS run.

Truth order (3 tiers, flat — receipt-driven; see
`handover/architect-insights/K-2-2_TRUTH_TIER_GREP_RECEIPTS.md` for src/ grep
evidence):

**Tier 1: Axioms** (immutable, checked at compile/start time)
- `constitution.md`
- The 3 canonical flowchart hashes (stored in tests and docs)

**Tier 2: Facts** (live state machine)
- ChainTape (L4 + L4.E transitions)
- CAS (evidence objects, indexed by content hash)
- Replay/audit verifier (deterministic reconstruction from ChainTape + CAS)

**Tier 3: Workspace pointers** (mutable, derived)
- Current TB charter / directive / ratification
- `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` (explicit derived view; ChainTape wins if conflict)

**Derived views** (all below tier 3 — no src/ runtime reader, per K-2.2 receipts):
- `handover/alignment/CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md`
- `handover/alignment/TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md`
- `handover/tracer_bullets/TB_LOG.tsv` (append-only log)
- Dashboards, reports, README files, stdout logs

If a derived view contradicts ChainTape/CAS, trust ChainTape/CAS.
If ChainTape/CAS contradicts constitution gates, stop.

## 2. Cold Start

**THIS file (`AGENTS.md`) is the canonical universal entry for ALL coding
agent CLIs** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, Cursor, Windsurf,
GitHub Copilot, Warp, Antigravity, and any future runtime. Each CLI has its own
thin discovery file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `.cursorrules`,
`.cursor/rules/000-agents-alignment.mdc`, `.windsurfrules`,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `WARP.md`) but those files all redirect
here. If any thin entry file contradicts `AGENTS.md`, **`AGENTS.md` wins**.

For a new non-trivial task, read in this order regardless of CLI:

1. `AGENTS.md` (this file — canonical agent contract)
2. `HARNESS_PLAYBOOK.md` (full operating manual — K-HARDEN, lessons L1-L9, K-2.3 drift, etc.)
3. `HARNESS.md` (architecture vocabulary, H1-H5 gate ladder, kill gates — supplemental reference)
4. `constitution.md` (axiom layer)
5. `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` (current session state — derived view)
6. Key Coding Principles: [KARPATHY_ARCHITECT.md](skills/KARPATHY_ARCHITECT.md) & [KARPATHY_SIMPLE_CODE.md](skills/KARPATHY_SIMPLE_CODE.md)
7. `handover/alignment/CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md`
8. `handover/alignment/TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md`
9. Current directives/charters relevant to the task
10. Source files and tests for the touched surface

CLI-specific notes:
- **Claude Code** additionally reads `CLAUDE.md` + optional memory under
  `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (do not depend on this path on other
  machines).
- Every other CLI reads its own thin discovery file (listed above) and/or
  `AGENTS.md` directly; all redirect here. Antigravity needs no thin file — the
  universal contract suffices.

### Two-layer model (unify the contract, not the mechanism)

The harness unifies the *contract*, never the *mechanism*:

- **Layer 1 — universal contract (this file).** Truth order (§1), risk classes
  (§5), restricted surfaces (§6), PR-only workflow (§14a), audit doctrine (§9),
  obligation ledger (§16), tape-first evidence (§4), Karpathy principles (§13).
  `AGENTS.md` is the *only* home of a rule; thin discovery files point here,
  never restate it.
- **Layer 2 — platform-native enhancement.** Each platform realizes the one
  contract with its own native tooling (Claude hooks / skills / subagents,
  Cursor `.mdc`, Aider config, …). Layer 2 may only **ADD**; it may never
  restate-and-narrow a Layer-1 rule (e.g. listing a *subset* of §6 reads as
  "only these are restricted" — point to §6, don't re-list).

`tests/cli_entry_files_redirect_to_agents.rs` enforces both halves: each thin
file must redirect here and must not name a restricted surface absent from §6.

Dynamic state belongs in `handover/ai-direct/LATEST.md` and
`handover/tracer_bullets/TB_LOG.tsv`, not in this file. Do not encode current
HEADs, gate counts, temporary freezes, or active round counts in `AGENTS.md`.

Default user-facing language is Chinese. Technical terms may remain in English.

## 3. Constitution Flowcharts

The current constitution has the three-flowchart version:

- FC1: Runtime loop, `constitution.md` around line 455.
  `Q_t -> rtool -> input -> Agent delta -> output -> predicates -> wtool -> Q_{t+1}`.
- FC2: Boot/full architecture, `constitution.md` around line 571.
  Human spec / InitAI / predicates / Q0 / map-reduce tick / halt.
- FC3: Meta-architecture, `constitution.md` around line 826.
  Constitution + logs archive -> ArchitectAI/Veto-AI -> tools/logs -> feedback -> re-init.

`handover/alignment/TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md` carries the canonical hashes.
FC1 is split into 1a/1b hashes because the runtime loop spans two fragments.
Treat those hashes as architectural contracts; changing the flowcharts is a
Class 4 constitution event.

Before designing or implementing any non-trivial change, state which FC nodes
or invariants the change touches. If the FC mapping is unclear, inspect
`TRACE_FLOWCHART_MATRIX.md` before editing.

## 4. Operating Loop

Prime operating mode: Constitutional Harness Engineering.

Required loop:

1. Write or identify the constitution/test gate first.
2. Run the minimal real evidence path when the change is evidence-bearing.
3. Implement only enough to make the harness and evidence correct.
4. Re-run the relevant checks.
5. For high-risk or ship-path work, request a clean-context audit (any capable
   platform) after implementation evidence exists.
6. Ship only after gates, evidence, and review agree.

Forbidden loop:

```text
charter -> atom -> self-audit -> external audit -> more docs -> delayed test
```

No tape, no test. Stdout, human-readable dashboards, private counters, LLM
self-reports, final proof text, unanchored JSON, memory-only preseed, or global
latest pointers are not sufficient evidence.

### 4.1 Pre-charter parallel-write check (lightweight, universal)

Before drafting any charter that will touch `src/` or `scripts/`, check for
in-flight PRs that claim overlapping paths. This is a 2-second lookup, not a
new mechanism — there is no central lock, no state file, no scheduler. Intent:
prevent the orchestrator and a parallel implementer (Codex/Gemini/another
Claude session) from doing duplicate or colliding work on mainline.

Canonical command (works wherever the GitHub CLI runs — Linux/macOS/Windows):

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,title,files \
  --jq '.[] | {n:.number, br:.headRefName, t:.title, f:[.files[].path]}'
```

Equivalent fallbacks (use whichever your runtime exposes):

- Claude Code (web/remote env without `gh`): GitHub MCP `list_pull_requests` +
  `pull_request_read` for the `files` view.
- Codex CLI / Gemini CLI / Aider / Cursor / human shell: `gh pr list ...` above.
- No network: `git fetch origin && git for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' refs/remotes/origin/ | grep -v main` to enumerate active feature branches.

Decision rule (no new tooling, no charter field):

- No overlap with planned paths → proceed.
- Overlap → either wait for the in-flight PR to merge, narrow the charter to
  non-overlapping paths, or coordinate explicitly with the other writer (note
  it in the charter §3 "Predecessor / dependency" block).

Do not build a path-lock file, a charter overlap database, or a dispatcher.
Collisions are rare and recoverable (`git rebase`, re-run the atom). The check
exists so we don't dispatch a parallel branch we already know will conflict.

### 4.2 No silent idle — execution liveness (session-mined 2026-06-03)

不得静默 idle。(1) 长任务或派发 sub-agent 后须主动汇报进度，不许无声停摆；
(2) 派出的 sub-agent 久不返回时，主动检查其状态、从已有缓存/中间产物抢救已
完成的工作，避免重复劳动，不要无声干等；(3) 自身因上下文中断则从断处续做，
不得停在原地等用户主动催“你 idle 了吗”。本条是会话/编排级 liveness，区别于
实验级 checkpoint（per-unit checkpoint + --resume，另见相应 long-run 规则）。
Claude-Code 特有的失败症状——工具调用格式错误导致以**原始 XML 文本**显示而非
执行——见 `CLAUDE.md §10`。Evidence: recurring across 3 sessions.

### 4.3 Full real E2E before handoff (session-mined 2026-06-03)

§0 directive 2 的细则。触发点有两个——**用户参与测试前** 与 **你声明“完成”前**，
两者皆须先由 agent 亲自从真实二进制入口（`turingos init`/`genesis`）完整跑通一次
并贴 evidence；读代码 / 标签 / self-report / proxy 不算。只有你全程跑通，用户参与
才有效率——**禁止把未跑通的产物移交给用户测试**。需模拟用户时，sub-agent 只接收
persona + 目标约束，零预设答案、零标准答案，仅依据页面当前内容作答（blind sim）。

### 4.4 Autonomy default & legal stop points (session-mined 2026-06-03)

§0 directive 3 的细则。目标是全部 PR/任务 all-merged；合法停机点只有 (a) all-merged
或 (b) Class-4 §8 ratification gate（`fix`/`go`/`ok` 等单词不构成 §8 sign-off）。merge
由 orchestrator 负责（§14a：agent 只能开 PR）——这是执行方式约束、**不是停机理由**：
开完一个 PR 立即推进下一个 atom，不要停下等 merge 确认，也不要因“无权 merge”
而停机。此 autonomy default 永不凌驾 §5 Class-4 / §6 restricted surfaces。

## 5. Risk Classes

Use the project risk model before editing:

- Class 0: docs, plans, charters, handover updates.
- Class 1: additive isolated helpers, parsers, formatters, non-authoritative
  views.
- Class 2: production wire-up, evaluator adapters, dashboards, replay
  verifiers, benchmark harness code.
- Class 3: auth, money, CAS integrity, capabilities, market/economic state,
  production evidence, `audit_tape`.
- Class 4: constitution, flowcharts, sequencer admission, typed transaction
  schema, canonical signing payload, RootBox/kernel-level authority.

Class 3/4 work requires harness -> real evidence -> audit. Do not audit a
failing harness as a pass.

Class 4 requires explicit per-atom section-8 architect/user ratification before
implementation or ship. One-word messages such as `fix`, `go`, `ok`,
`continue`, or `can` do not constitute Class 4 sign-off.

## 6. Restricted Surfaces

Stop and classify before editing any of these:

- `src/kernel.rs`
- `src/bus.rs`
- `src/sdk/tools/wallet.rs`
- `src/state/sequencer.rs`
- `src/state/typed_tx.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs`
- RootBox or canonical signing payload surfaces
- Any sequencer admission rule
- Any typed tx wire schema or discriminant
- Any trust-root or constitution/flowchart authority surface

If a change touches sequencer admission, typed tx schema, or canonical signing
payloads, treat it as Class 4 candidate until proven otherwise. Class 4 cannot
hide inside a Class 3 umbrella.

## 7. Commands

Preferred checks:

```bash
cargo check
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast
bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh
make constitution
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --tests --no-deps
```

Use `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` for ship-level workspace reports,
not bare `cargo test`. Use targeted tests during development, then broaden
according to risk.

`bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` and `make constitution` are the
constitutional gate paths. Gate tests must be able to fail; a test that cannot
fail is documentation, not a gate.

## 8. Dirty Tree and Evidence

You may start in a dirty worktree. Never revert user changes, generated
evidence, or unrelated drift unless the user explicitly asks. If unrelated
files are modified, ignore them. If existing changes affect your task, work
with them and explain the interaction.

Before any runner that writes to `handover/evidence/` or evaluates real
problems, invoke `/runner-preflight` when available or follow its checklist:

1. clean/understood tree
2. fresh binaries vs current source/HEAD
3. evidence immutability
4. risk class
5. FC trace
6. charter/directive completeness
7. audit-round state

Do not edit Trust-Root-pinned source files during active batch runs. If a fix
is needed mid-batch, abort the batch or accept the wasted run before editing.

Never retroactively rewrite old ChainTape/L4/L4.E/CAS evidence, fabricate a
genesis report, or migrate historical evidence to satisfy new rules. New rules
apply going forward. If an old document is stale, add a new OBS/annotation
document rather than mutating historical evidence.

## 9. Audit Default

Default and only audit path for this repository is **one clean-context audit by
a fresh agent on any capable platform** (Claude, Codex, Antigravity, or any
future capable runtime). The auditor must run in a clean context and must not
have the implementation transcript. One independent witness is sufficient; this
repository does not require a second.

This doctrine is **platform-agnostic**: it names a *role* (a fresh,
clean-context auditor), not a vendor. All older vendor-specific phrasings —
"single Codex", "Codex + Gemini dual audit", "Gemini dropped" — are superseded
by the ratification line below.

> Ratification 2026-05-29: audit doctrine generalized to **platform-agnostic
> clean-context audit**; supersedes single-Codex (2026-05-24) and the earlier
> dual Codex+Gemini doctrine. The requirement is clean context + no
> implementation transcript, not a particular vendor.

Implementation agents must not self-certify high-risk work. For Class 3/4 or
ship-path changes, after implementation evidence exists, invoke a fresh
clean-context auditor (any capable platform). Provide only:

- task brief and risk class
- touched FC nodes/invariants
- current diff or commit
- relevant source/docs
- evidence paths
- exact verification command output
- required verdict format: `PROCEED | CHALLENGE | VETO`

Do not provide the implementation transcript. The reviewer must lead with
findings, cite files/lines, distinguish production defects from test-scaffold
gaps, and end with a clear verdict.

Conservative interpretation:

- `VETO` blocks ship.
- `CHALLENGE` requires fix or explicit forward deferral with rationale.
- `PROCEED` is necessary but not a substitute for passing gates/evidence.

## 10. (retired 2026-05-29)

The self-hosting `turingos_dev` sidecar was removed (Phase 2). §11–§16 retain
their numbers so existing `AGENTS.md §NN` citations across the thin CLI files,
skills, and `CLAUDE.md` stay valid.

## 11. Done Definition

A task is done only when:

- The touched FC nodes and risk class are stated.
- Relevant unit/integration/constitution gates pass.
- Evidence-bearing changes have a minimal real run or an explicit reason why no
  real run is required.
- The diff is reviewed for regressions, hidden Class 4 surfaces, evidence
  rewrite, ID namespace drift, and money/tape/shielding violations.
- Clean-context audit (any capable platform) is completed for high-risk or
  ship-path work.
- Dynamic handover files are updated only if current project state actually
  changed.
- `OBLIGATIONS.md` reconciled: every `Level=must` entry is `satisfied`
  (with evidence path), `blocked` (with blocker + proof), or `superseded`
  (with explicit user trigger phrase + `superseded-by`). No `open` must.
  See `skills/OBLIGATIONS_LEDGER.md`.

For docs-only changes like this file, no Rust tests are required unless the doc
change also modifies scripts, source code, or executable workflow.

## 12. Engineering Rules

Use `rg`/`rg --files` for search. Prefer existing patterns, types, parsers, and
helpers over inventing new abstractions. Keep edits scoped to the task.

For structured data, use structured parsers/APIs where available. Avoid ad hoc
string parsing for schemas, manifests, chain records, or evidence payloads.

Money/economy paths must use integer math only. No `f64`/`f32` in money or
market conservation paths.

Agent read views must be scoped, reconstructable, and shielded. Do not expose
raw Lean stderr, raw autopsy logs, private diagnostics, benchmark leaks, or
untriaged historical logs in ordinary agent prompts.

Canonical IDs and shadow IDs must not be mixed. Dashboard and report code must
derive from ChainTape/CAS, not become a source of truth.

No workaround closures: admission and gates are fail-closed by default — do not
turn a failing gate into a skip, null pointer, empty evidence path, or
dashboard-only proof. Align with the constitution and FC1/FC2/FC3, or stop.

## 13. Key Coding Principles (Karpathy Skills)

All agents must strictly adhere to the following coding and architectural guidelines:

- **Karpathy Architect Skill**: Apply first-principles architecture, data-flow-first design, monolithic/flat default architecture, and micro-implementation. See [KARPATHY_ARCHITECT.md](file:///home/zephryj/projects/turingosv4/skills/KARPATHY_ARCHITECT.md).
- **Karpathy Simple Code Skill**: Focus on direct computation, small state machines, transparent data flow, and minimal abstractions. Avoid unnecessary dependencies and boilerplate lifecycle complexity. See [KARPATHY_SIMPLE_CODE.md](file:///home/zephryj/projects/turingosv4/skills/KARPATHY_SIMPLE_CODE.md).

## 14. Class-by-Class Cadence & Audit Checklist (K-4.1, v3 plan §5)

### Cadence

Match ceremony to risk class — Karpathy: surgical changes. Old loop (charter →
atom → self-audit → external audit → more docs → delayed test) is forbidden;
required loop is constitution gate → real run → debug → fix → rerun → audit →
ship.

| Class | Charter | Directive | Matrix update | §8 | Independent audit (witness only) | Memory |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|-----|-----------------------------------|--------|
| 0 docs | no | no | no | no | no | only recurring rule |
| 1 additive | no | no | no | no | predicate self-test only | only recurring rule |
| 2 wire-up | brief | optional | yes | no | clean-context audit, any platform (witness, output `{NO-VIOLATION, VIOLATION-FOUND, RECONSTRUCTION-FAILURE, SECOND-SOURCE-DRIFT}`) | surprise only |
| 3 auth/money/CAS | TB charter | yes | yes | required | clean-context audit (witness, one independent — any capable platform, see §9) | yes |
| 4 constitution/sequencer | TB charter | yes | yes | per-atom §8 | clean-context audit PRE-§8 (witness, one independent — any capable platform, see §9) | yes |

**Audit witness is not judge.** Ship gate = predicates GREEN (hard judge —
`cargo test --workspace`, `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`,
`cargo test --test constitution_matrix_drift`) ∧ audit witness output ≠
unresolved violation. Subjective code-style / performance / coverage /
architecture-preference opinions are out-of-scope per constitutional Veto-AI
boundary (output domain `{PASS, VETO}`).

### Predicate verification checklist (pre-merge, machine-deterministic)

Auditor copy-pastes this batch; no human judgment in any line:

- [ ] PR title states risk class
- [ ] `git diff main --name-only` 未触及 §6 restricted-surface 列表，OR 该 PR 引用 per-atom §8 directive 文件
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` exit 0
- [ ] `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` exit 0
- [ ] `cargo test --test constitution_matrix_drift` exit 0
- [ ] PR body 含 acceptance-criteria 命令块与期望输出
- [ ] 该 atom 自身的 predicate verification recipe 输出 `PREDICATES-GREEN`
- [ ] 无新 `Manager` / `Factory` / `Engine` / `Platform` / `Framework` type（structural grep）
- [ ] 无新 trait + 单一非-idiomatic impl（structural grep）
- [ ] 无新 board-as-truth 文件存在 evidence chain 外
- [ ] 无新 global latest pointer 作为 canonical input

### Independent audit witness verdict domain

Clean-context audit (any capable platform) 可合法输出（仅这四个，见 §9）:
- `NO-VIOLATION`（扫了 N 条款，无违宪发现）
- `VIOLATION-FOUND <constitutional-clause> <file>:<line>`
- `RECONSTRUCTION-FAILURE <which-tape-or-cas-path-cannot-be-reconstructed>`
- `SECOND-SOURCE-DRIFT <which-derived-view-is-usurping-ground-truth>`

出现以下即越界，可由 user 或 Claude 主体拒收该次 audit 报告：
- "I think the code style ..."
- "Performance could be improved ..."
- "Test coverage feels low ..."
- "Architecture would be better if ..."
- 任何其他主观品味 / 性能 / 覆盖率 / 架构偏好类语句

### Obligation completeness witness (K-OBL-1, 2026-05-24)

Separate witness role per `skills/OBLIGATIONS_LEDGER.md §3 Rule 4`. Reads
`OBLIGATIONS.md` and emits exactly one of:
- `OBL-ALL-CLOSED`
- `OBL-OPEN-MUST <OBL-id>`
- `OBL-EVIDENCE-MISSING <OBL-id>`
- `OBL-BLOCKER-UNVERIFIED <OBL-id>`

A `PROCEED` from any other audit witness is **invalid** if obligation
witness verdict ≠ `OBL-ALL-CLOSED`. The obligation witness does not opine on
code/style/architecture — same subjective-opinion boundary as above.

### Pre-dispatch grounding (session-mined 2026-06-03)

把上面机械可核验的验收标准从 audit 侧延伸到 **plan 侧**。派发任何复杂任务或
多-agent 分工**之前**：(1) 先声明你对任务的理解，并把完整拆解（atom 列表）呈给
用户确认，获明确批准后再执行——任务复杂或方案不明时先研究、与用户确认方案，
不要直接开干；(2) 每个 atom 的颗粒度须细到**低思考深度 flash-model agent** 能
独立执行，指令自包含、不依赖上下文补全；(3) 每个 atom 须附**机械可核验**的验收
标准（具体命令 + 期望输出），auditor 可直接 copy-paste 验证、零人工判断（与上面
checklist 同一标准，只是施加在派发前）；(4) 验收标准与 Karpathy 取舍（§13）对齐。
Evidence: recurring across 3 sessions.

## 14a. PR-only workflow (K-HARDEN-7, 2026-05-20) — universal across agent runtimes

**All coding agents may only create pull requests. Approval + merge is the
orchestrator's responsibility.**

Applies to: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, Cursor, human shell
sessions, CI bots, every future coding-agent runtime. Cross-platform enforced
via three independent layers:

| Layer | Scope | Bypass |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GitHub branch protection on main | Server-side, universal | Repo admin only |
| `scripts/hooks/pre-push.harden` (git pre-push hook) | Any agent that respects git hooks | `--no-verify` or `GIT_HARDEN_ALLOW_MAIN=1` |
| Claude Code `.claude/hooks/validate_git_push.sh` | Claude Code only | env var or other agent |

Install local hooks once per clone:
```
bash scripts/install_hooks.sh
```

Enable GitHub-side server protection (one-time, admin):
```
bash scripts/setup_branch_protection.sh
```

Legitimate orchestrator bypass (merging a vetted PR locally):
```
GIT_HARDEN_ALLOW_MAIN=1 git push origin main
```

See `skills/SUBAGENT_HARNESS.md` for prompt-template patterns and
`handover/architect-insights/K_HARDEN_PROPOSAL_2026-05-20.md` for design
rationale.

## 15. Harness Guidance Maintenance

This file should stay concise and load-bearing. If any agent repeats the same
mistake twice, **prefer a mechanism (a gate test that can fail) over more prose —
prose at the margin does not change behavior**; update `AGENTS.md` only for a
genuinely load-bearing rule, else create a small referenced playbook/skill. If
this file grows too large, split task-specific material into separate docs and
reference them here. Keep instructions minimal, accurate, high-signal over long
repeated policy.

## 16. User Obligation Ledger (K-OBL-1, 2026-05-24)

Universal across all agent runtimes.

Per-project file: `<project_root>/OBLIGATIONS.md`. Tracks user-stated obligations
across multi-turn conversations to prevent **Conversational Anchor Drift** (silent
task substitution when the user offers mid-flight debug input). Lesson source:
V-010 — a 15-persona E2E mandate silently replaced by a UI fix; multi-agent audit
returned `PROCEED` on the substitution. Full skill + schema:
`skills/OBLIGATIONS_LEDGER.md`.

### The four rules (mandatory, every agent)

1. **Create on first imperative** — at task Class ≥ 1, create `OBLIGATIONS.md`
   if missing; extract user imperatives into `OBL-001..OBL-00N`.
2. **Every-turn reconcile** — implementation/audit/completion turns must begin
   with `Active obligations: OBL-001 (open), OBL-002 (satisfied), ... → next`.
3. **No implicit redefinition** — user debug input = input to existing OBL or
   new sub-OBL, **never replacement**. Replacement needs an explicit user
   trigger phrase (`取消 X` / `不要 X 了` / `改用 Y 代替 X`).
4. **Done gate** — no `done` / `完成` / `PROCEED` while any `Level=must` is
   `open`. See §11.

### Audit integration

Obligation completeness is a separate witness role with its own verdict
domain — see §14 "Obligation completeness witness". A `PROCEED` from any
other audit witness is invalid if obligation witness ≠ `OBL-ALL-CLOSED`.

### Cross-platform discovery

All thin discovery files (see §2) already redirect here. No per-agent shim.
One file, one schema, every agent.
